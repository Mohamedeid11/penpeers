    <span class="text-huge"><strong>L</strong></span
    >iving in the Light was èrst published in <u>1986</u>. Since that time,
    <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace"
        >it has sold over a million copies</span
    >
    and has been translated into many languages all over the world. Today, it
    continues to sell steadily and I receive continuous feedback that it is
    touching people’s lives in a meaningful way. Not long ago, I revised and
    updated my èrst book, Creative Visualization, and ever since that time, I’ve
    been feeling that I’d like to do the same for Living in the Light. The basic
    message of the book seems to be as timely and relevant as ever. Over the
    years since I wrote it, however, my understanding has developed and
    <i><mark class="marker-yellow">(hopefully)</mark></i> deepened through my
    own life experience and my work with others. I felt that there were many
    things I would say somewhat differently now and that perhaps it would be
    valuable to my readers to hear more of my ongoing story as well as some of
    my <s>“older and wiser”</s> perspectives.
</p>
<h4>New Experiences</h4>
<p>
    Over the next few years, I began to have new experiences, openings, and a
    growing awareness that did not fit into my former rational framework. In
    college, I studied psychology and got involved in some encounter groups and
    sensitivity training groups that, in addition to allowing me to release old
    emotional pain, led me to new feelings of love, joy, and oneness with all. I
    studied dance and discovered that when I was dancing, I would often have an
    exhilarating feeling as if <code>var c = 8;</code> some higher force had
    taken over and was moving me in an abandoned and thrilling way.

    consciousness, a radical transformation is taking place. As the evolution of
    human consciousness gains greater and greater momentum, we are being
    challenged, on a planetary level, to let go of our present way of life and
    create a new one. In a sense, our

        the material world is the only reality. Thus, feeling essentially lost,

        universe within us and consciously allow that creative energy to move
        through us. As each of us connects with our inner spiritual awareness,
        we learn that the creative power of the universe is inside of us.

<h3><strong>Meditation</strong></h3>
<p>
    Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and take a few
    deep breaths. Each time you exhale, relax your body more and more. Then take
    a few more deep breaths and, each time you exhale, relax your mind. Let your
    thoughts drift by without holding onto any of them. Allow your mind to go
    out of focus. Relax your awareness into a deep place within you. Imagine
    that there is a very powerful presence within you. This presence is totally
    loving, strong, and wise. It is nurturing, protecting, guiding, and caring
    for you.

    />Imagine that there is a very powerful presence within you. This presence
    is totally loving, strong, and wise. It is nurturing, protecting, guiding,
    and caring for you. At times it can be very strong and forceful. It can also
    be very light, joyful, and playful. As you get to know and trust it, it will
    make your life exciting, meaningful, and fulèlling. You may get an image or
    a feeling or a physical sensation that represents this higher presence. Even
    if you don’t see or feel a thing, assume it is there regardless. Relax and
    enjoy the feeling or thought that you are being totally taken care of by the
    universe. Say this afèrmation to yourself silently or aloud,

    This is where we ènd ourselves in opposition to life as most of us have been
    taught to live it in the old world. In modern western civilization, we have
    learned to respect and even worship the rational, logical aspect of our
    being, and to dismiss, depreciate, or deny our intuition. We do acknowledge
    the ability of animals to seemingly understand things that are way beyond
    their rational capacity; we call this instinct. But it’s a mystery that
    deèes logical explanation, so we shrug our shoulders and dismiss it as
    something vastly inferior to the magniècent human ability to reason.

        Our culture’s entire value system is èrmly based on the belief that the

        has become our religion. We are taught from a young age to try to be
        reasonable, logical, and consistent, to avoid emotional, irrational
        behavior, and to suppress our feelings.
    </li>
    <li>
        At best, feelings and emotions are considered foolish, weak, and
        bothersome. At worst, we fear they may threaten the very fabric of
        civilized society.

    In human evolution, it seems that as our rational capacity has evolved,
    we’ve grown increasingly fearful of the other aspects of our natures. We’ve
    attempted to control these “dark forces” by creating authoritative rule
    structures that deène right and wrong,

    >o whatever degree you listen to and follow your intuition, you become a
    “creative channel” for the higher power of the universe. When you willingly
    follow where your creative energy leads, the higher power can come through
    you to manifest its creative work. When this happens, you will ènd yourself
    éowing with the energy, doing what you really want to do, and feeling the
    power of the universe moving through you to create or transform everything
    around you.

    In using the word channel, I am not referring to the process of trance
    channeling. Trance channeling involves a medium who goes into a trance state
    and allows another being to speak through him or her. By channeling, I mean
    being in touch with and bringing through the wisdom and creativity of your
    own deepest source.

<p>
    Being a channel is being fully and freely yourself and consciously knowing
    that you are a vehicle for the creativity of the universe.
