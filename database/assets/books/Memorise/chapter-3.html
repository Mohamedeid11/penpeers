<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why the question mark after Benchley’s name? The answer
    is not that our memory is failing us – it does look as if we don’t remember
    who said that line. The truth is, we had clipped that quotation from a
    newspaper which credits Franklin P. Adams as the owner of the quote, but in
    a book about memory written by Robert Allen, the same quote appeared but
    cites Robert Benchley instead.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks to our memory, we remembered seeing that line
    before and all we had to do was go to our quote file and there it was.
    Either both men did utter the same sentence (highly unlikely) or it’s a mere
    typographical error (more likely).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A bad memory is the last thing we’d want. We scold
    ourselves for forgetting to buy an important ingredient after we’ve come
    back from the supermarket. We scold ourselves because we forgot our wedding
    anniversary and hence got a severe reprimand and a cold shoulder in return.
    We scold ourselves because we forgot our dental appointment and then got
    fined $50.00 for a no-show. Unfortunately, even dentists act like policemen
    nowadays. One fines you for speeding, and the other penalizes you for not
    showing up. If we had to pay fines for everything we forgot, we’d be
    bankrupt by now. That does not bode well for our financial future; nor does
    it bode well for the future of our mind.

        ><strong><u>Brief Visit to Memory Lane</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">What exactly is this thing called memory?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It depends from what perspective we look at it. In
    Psychology, memory is a human being’s ability to store and remember bits and
    pieces of information and eventually to use such information when the need
    arises. Memory used to fall under the field of philosophy, but in the early
    20 century, it was integrated into cognitive psychology. Today, memory now
    properly belongs to a branch of science that combines cognitive psychology
    and neuroscience. Thus, it is now under the realm of cognitive neuroscience.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given that the study of memory in cognitive neuroscience
    is complex, we shall not attempt to dissect it and examine its numerous
    facets. This complexity has resulted in a multi-classification system
    wherein memory has been classified by duration, by information type and by
    temporal direction.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For our purposes, we will take the first classification
    – by duration – and explain it briefly before we deal with ways to improve
    our memory. Under memory by duration, we have three types:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Sensory memory</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Short-term memory, and</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Long-term memory</span>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to Wikipedia, sensory memory corresponds to
    the first instant that a person or object is noticed. This observation
    sometimes moves into the sensory store, and qualifies as short-term memory.
    Sensory memory means that the observation or perception lasts from
    milliseconds to seconds. Short-term memory, in turn, corresponds to memory
    that occurs from seconds to minutes. Immediate interaction with things,
    objects and persons constitute our sensory memory as they are information
    produced by our five senses. Touching, smelling or seeing are faculties that
    enable us to remember more easily.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Long-term memory is memory that is stored and then
    retrieved after days and years.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An example may help us understand this system of
    classification better: supposing someone gives us his number. We remember it
    for a few seconds – maybe even up to a minute or two, but soon forget it.
    This is short-term memory at work. On the other hand, we remember certain
    phone numbers that we use frequently. Our baby sitter’s number, the
    pharmacist’s, our husband’s office – these numbers are stored in our
    long-term memory.
</p>

    <span style="color: #4c4ce6"
        ><strong><u>Memory Improvement Techniques</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert Allen wrote a useful manual on improving your
    memory and certainly does not read like a technical manual similar to those
    you receive when you purchase computer hardware. With craft and imagination
    (and lots of color), he sets out some techniques and actual practices on how
    to maintain horsepower for your brain. This section will cover general
    techniques that generate benefits for us in the short and long term, and in
    the worksheets in Chapter Fifteen, we describe some exercises that you can
    do. You don’t have to adopt all of them. Choose a couple or at least one
    exercise that you can do consistently to develop your memory. One exercise
    is better than none. As Robert Allen said, “If you start today and practice,
    practice, practice, soon your memory will be as a retentive as flypaper
    (though what gets stuck to it will, with luck, be more useful).”
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s a pity that our memories don’t act the same way as
    computers. A computer-like brain would be a boon to our daily lives wouldn’t
    it? The human brain, although not as dazzling a performer as a Pentium IV,
    is far more complex; however, while it may not be able to spew out chunks of
    data in minutes, the human mind has been responsible for how humanity and
    civilization evolved. This makes memory a very valuable asset and tool. It
    is not mechanical; it’s the stuff we’re made of.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before describing specific memory improvement
    techniques, we’ll take a quick refresher on two aspects of memory: learning
    and concentration.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each person has his own way of learning and
    concentrating. These two stages are prerequisites to memory building.
    Learning is the acquisition of data and actual skills, while concentration
    is the mind’s ability to focus well on something with the least amount of
    distraction.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6"
        ><strong><u>Learning</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert Allen says that individuals learn in three ways:
    looking, listening and doing. There are individuals who rely mostly on
    sight, others on their sense of hearing and still others who learn by doing.
    Certain measurements exist to gauge one’s most predominant learning style.
    We’ll deal briefly with some of these practical tests:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For instance, after watching a movie, which part do you
    remember most - the dialogue, the action sequences, or the things you did,
    like driving to the cinema, buying the movie pass and popcorn? If you
    answered “dialogue”, that makes you a listener. If you answered “action
    sequences”, you are a looker, and if you answered the “things you did”, that
    makes you a doer.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another example: if you moved to a new city, how would
    you find your way around: (a) ask people for directions, (b) buy a map, or
    (c) walked around the neighborhood to familiarize yourself with the layout
    of the city? If you answered (a), you are a listener, if you picked (b),
    you’re a looker and if you chose (c), you are a doer.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course we need more scientific tests to determine how
    a person learns and what type of learner he is – a listener, a looker or a
    doer. Two or twenty two questions will not result in an accurate assessment,
    but Allen’s examples at least give you an idea of his learning theory; and
    as we said earlier, learning is an essential ingredient of memory.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A learner who listens is one who enjoys sounds –
    especially words – and finds powerful meanings in them. Listeners tend to
    remember best what they’ve absorbed through their sense of hearing, rather
    than from any other sensory perception. Lookers, on the other hand, react
    best to visual stimuli so anything they see is understood and retained more
    efficiently. The doers are individuals who like to roll up their sleeves and
    dig into the trenches. They put emphasis on practical experience; to them,
    doing things hands-on holds more meaning.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Allen believes that it is rare for anyone to learn
    things exclusively in one style. He says the best form of attack would be to
    combine all three learning styles and adapt each one to a given situation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6"
        ><strong><u>Concentration</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can have the best tutor for memory building, but if
    you can’t concentrate, it would be difficult to have much of an efficient
    memory. Concentrating is a difficult art to master; look how much technology
    has taken over our lives. In the mind-training courses he took throughout
    his life, Allen says there is one technique that might help some individuals
    develop their concentration skills. This one is adopted from a Far Eastern
    culture, he says, and is a century-old practice, but is still valuable. It
    sounds easy enough but your initial efforts at actually doing it may seem
    futile:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    Light a candle and set it on a table where you can see it clearly;&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    Stare at the candle for two minutes and take in every detail: color, wax,
    size, the flickering of the flame, etc.;&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    Close your eyes and keep the image of the candle in your mind’s eye – hold
    this image for as long as you can;&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    Don’t be discouraged by your first or second attempt. Keep trying until you
    can hold the image of the candle as long as you can.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now that we’ve dealt with the two indispensable
    ingredients for memory building, let’s “concentrate” on the ways to improve
    our memory:
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do you think is the most fundamental tenet for
    improving your memory? Allen states it clearly. Take care of yourself!
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Body and mind are one. Don’t kid yourself thinking that
    you can set about your merry way doing things you want to do and neglect
    your physical self. The following rules, Allen says, are things you hear
    repeatedly. They still have their weight in gold – old advice but good
    advice, so pay heed to them:
</p>
<h4><strong>1. Sufficient sleep</strong></h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not having enough sleep is a barrier to concentration
    and learning. On those days where you had insufficient rest and sleep, were
    you as productive at work or in school? Did you remember more and retain
    more, or did you brain feel fuzzy?
</p>
<h4><strong>2. Balanced Meals</strong></h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The experts have stressed, over and over again, that a
    good, balanced meal is therapy for stressed-out and burned-out lives. Good,
    healthy eating is essential for our memory to function at an optimal rate.
    Without the fuel our body needs, how can we expect our mind to be at its
    peak performance? Fresh and vegetables should fill your plate. According to
    researchers, those who eat breakfast have heightened powers of recalls than
    those who skip this important meal of the day.
</p>
<h4><strong>3. Fresh Air</strong></h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To benefit from fresh air, learn to breathe properly,
    and to be concerned about the air quality in our homes and offices. This
    means that as much as possible, we should have a window open while working,
    maintaining a comfortable temperature in the room. Stale air that is not
    allowed to circulate properly affects our concentration and mental
    processing abilities.
</p>
<h4><strong>4. Physical Exercise</strong></h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Not many people appreciate aerobics or weight-lifting. If
    you’re one of them, go for long walks or swim laps. The idea is to exercise
    at least 30 minutes per session most days of the week.
</p>
<h4><strong>5. Alcohol and Smoking</strong></h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Big NO! The famous “hang-over” we talk about after a
    night of partying and “boozing-up” can impair our thinking, concentration
    and memory. For our memory to work, eliminate alcohol and smoking from your
    routine especially if you do it to excess. An occasional slip-up may
    “produce a mere memory blip, but long-term abuse can mess up your mind in
    various unpleasant ways. Loss of memory will certainly be one of them.”
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    In Chapter Fifteen of this e-book, we have prepared a worksheet for memory
    building exercises, culled from a few works from recognized experts on the
    subject.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6"
        ><strong><u>Memletics: Hype or Truth?</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Memletics should not be confused with mnemonics,
    although the two are closely linked. Mnemonics has been in use for several
    decades but it won’t hurt to “refresh our memory” a bit: mnemonics is a
    memory helper and serves an educational purpose. Most of it is verbal and
    special words or phrases (and sometimes even poems) to help an individual
    remember something – as in lists.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mnemonics presupposes that there are two kinds of
    memory: natural (the one we’re born with) and artificial (the mind training
    tools we learn, practice and use to remember a considerable amount of data).
    Some people have advanced the idea that memory feats could be achieved with
    a properly-trained mind that the natural memory may be incapable of
    achieving.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Memletics is an offshoot of the revolution that gave
    rise to many memory and learning techniques that have been created, designed
    and marketed by individuals and companies.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The entrepreneurs who came up with Memletics – which
    they define as an accelerated learning program – say that it is really all
    about mental fitness. Memletics comes from two words: “memory” and
    “athletics.” It rests on the principle of mental fitness as the triggering
    factor for better learning and better memory through the use and application
    of several approaches. The developers call it an integrated learning system
    that enhances brain performance. The brain has a vast reserve of “raw
    material” and the course aims to help individuals process this raw material,
    so that unused powers of the brain come to the forefront.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The company who developed Memletics claims that it is a
    unique program because it compiles the research findings from different
    undertakings involving human performance. An improved memory is one that is
    mentally fit. And it is this degree of mental fitness that determines a
    person’s ability to learn and remember new information.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have read a few testimonials from people who have
    taken the Memletics program – some have praised it for producing a marked
    improvement in their memory. The Memletics developers explain that just as
    you don’t expect to run a marathon after having jogged a week, you can’t
    expect these mindtraining techniques to instantly endow you with a
    photographic memory. Your muscles take time to develop, and for them to
    reach their full potential, you have to use them consistently over a
    sustained period of time.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The same holds true for your brain, which as you know,
    is also a muscle which needs to be trained.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is one testimonial that was obviously written by a
    student:
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “I was searching for study tools. I was
    randomly googling for learning tools, accelerated learning, memory
    techniques etc. Suddenly I came across one site
    <a href="http://www.learning-styles-online.com"
        >http://www.learning-styles-online.com</a
    >. This site has a learning styles inventory test. It is a 70 questions test
    with simple questions. I did that test and they showed my inclination about
    how my learning abilities are less in some areas and how they can be
    improved. On this site I got the link site
    <a href="http://www.memletics.com">http://www.memletics.com</a> &nbsp;which
    they explain as Memory Athletics.”
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two more testimonials (this time from individuals who
    purchased the manual/book from Amazon:
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; “I am a professional investment advisor with a national firm
    (for 12 years) and have a four year degree from a major university in
    Finance. My advice to you is to NOT invest your dollars here!
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I bought this book because I am studying for the CFP
    (Certified Financial Planner) exam. I fell for the hype from the back page
    of the book, and I am embarrassed because I should have known better than to
    trust these sources I'd never heard of; hokey testimonials. I also failed to
    really evaluate that Amazon average "5 star" customer review. Ouch. It
    must've been late that night.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you want slightly above juvenile writing ability, a
    couple hundred pages of hackneyed phrases, goofy charts and pictures, and
    pathetic documentation, you'll find these attributes in "Memletics." At $50
    a copy, this book is a real rip-off! It represents little more than slick
    marketing (legit looking cover/techy-sounding title) of a hodge-podge of
    information that is, for the most part, at least twenty years old.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The index to this book was my first clue that the author
    is at best a hack (it is out of sync with the book...if it says "noise and
    concentration" p 34, it's really on pg 32...). Basic errors like this set
    the tone for worse things to come (like the horrible writing). It's like one
    of those "vanity press" cookbooks only worse.”
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We had to extract only the relevant comments for the
    book review but we have provided the link in the footnote so you can read
    the entire review, if you wish&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here is the last testimonial from a Chinese student who
    is studying to be a doctor and who also bought it from Amazon.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    “FYI, it did not seem to be a great book when I first skimmed it. I'm
    skeptical. But, then I made straight A's. Now I need to go back and pay
    attention to it! This book changed my life. I was getting stressed out. I'm
    middle aged, back in school and working. I know I'm trying to do too much.
    But, I want to go to school and I have to work. I want to do it all. But it
    was clear I could not keep it up, I was stressing. Then, finally, a system
    that works. So I can get good grades, and more importantly learn! I just
    knew there had to be a better way, and this is it. Before this book, I was
    struggling. I'm in Chinese medical School. It is fact intensive, complex and
    intense. Classes are 'taught' by Doctors who are not teachers. My grades
    were good, but I was working too hard, and spending hours and hours at
    re-learning things I kept forgetting. I had no time to question, what I was
    being told, or to understand. Worse, tests were full of questions that
    expected me to see relationships. Now, I can get thru it all. Now, I know
    what to do and how to do it. Memletics is especially good when there are
    just too many facts to cram in my brain. So far, it is a great book, but
    I've just started to use it. It has more to offer, that I have not tried
    yet.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In reading the description of the Memletics course
    program, it does say that without much mental effort on the part of the
    user, their product cannot improve memory. They warn people to stay away
    from a product that promises to improve memory without effort. They compare
    it to taking a weight pill without exercising.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, based on the testimonials we came across, one
    individual out of three gave a negative review. No doubt it has helped
    improve the learning and memory abilities of individuals; and these
    individuals most likely performed the exercises asked of them.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People who seek treatments for their illness report
    improvement while others lament the side effects of the treatment. It is the
    same with mind-training tools and approaches. One program may work for some
    and it may fail for others. The trick is to use your judgment and assess
    your own progress and skills.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So to answer the question: is Memletics hype or truth?
    We would have to say, it depends how much you
    <strong><u>want</u></strong> to gain from it.
