    >
</h2>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next to worrying about your car’s wear and tear and the
    sagging muscles in your body, how often do you think of keeping your brain
    fit and in the best of health?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When you consistently forget things and are unable to
    think creatively about your daily activities, do you simply shrug your
    shoulders and attribute this to the aging process?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A member of your family has been diagnosed with
    Alzheimer’s. Do you consider this disease the same way people think of
    cancer – that is, as an aging disease?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How much time do you allocate for mental and physical
    exercise?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Regardless of age, these questions should be gnawing at
    you because the sooner you take care of your brain, the better your chances
    of becoming alert and productive in your post-retirement years.
</p>

        ></span

</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nonsense. The thinking that brain health declines with
    age is a misleading belief and closes the door to exciting opportunities and
    research about age and the brain. If you read the web sites of the American
    Society of Aging and the American Association of Retired Persons, you will
    realize that there exists overwhelming evidence that older individuals can
    have as much brain power as teenagers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks to Princeton University researchers and others
    who have been studying the science of the brain, a “renewing” mechanism was
    discovered in mature brains; this renewing mechanism creates neurons that
    travel towards the cerebral cortex and become a part of the brain’s
    processing system.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When a fetus is formed, the brain begins to develop at
    just three weeks old. This pattern of growing, developing, expanding and
    adapting continues throughout its lifetime. Over 100 billion neurons are
    formed in a baby. In the next three years of the baby’s life, these neurons
    will develop trillions of what Dr. Gary Nulls calls “synaptic connections.”
    With the passage of time, those synapses that are exposed to constant
    stimulation become stronger and spread out, while those that are seldom used
    are discarded.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists have a name for this period of adaptive
    growth: “plasticity.” The Center for Brain Health in the University of Texas
    in Dallas takes the phenomenon of plasticity seriously. The Center has been
    conducting research for the last fifteen years which involves the close
    relationship of brain research and clinical care. Their primary objective is
    to promote the discovery and application of new interventions (e.g.,
    cognitive-linguistic, pharmacological, social) to maximize mental
    functioning.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up until a decade ago, physicians were telling patients
    who were complaining of memory loss and mental slowdown that this was
    something that comes as a result of the aging process: old neurons would die
    and nothing could replace them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a broad sense, brain health relies on constant
    stimulation, mental activity and challenge, thus confirming the popular
    expression, “use it or lose it.”
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Age, therefore, should not be our excuse. Our bodies,
    when taken care of conscientiously, will continue to serve us well. The same
    is true for the brain - if given the same proper attention, it will not
    abandon us. There is a price tag that comes with this. That price tag is our
    vigilance about the negative factors that contribute to unhealthy brains:
    environment, nutrition and diet, stress and emotion. An ounce of neglect in
    any of these factors could translate into a pound of trouble later on.

<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; We used to think that if we read six books a year, did
    crossword puzzles on the subway, and add and subtract numbers without using
    a calculator, we were doing our share of keeping mentally fit. These days, a
    lot has changed. Mental exercises like these are still excellent exercises
    and are being used by thousands, but new studies indicate that there are
    other mental – as well as physical - exercises that we can do to keep our
    gray matter in tip top form.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember those innocent days of our youth when we had fertile
    imagination and could easily conjure up situations and play pretend? When we
    ask our friends, “do you want to play with me today”, we’re actually
    extending an invitation for them to join us in whatever fantasy that’s

    cure little Sue because she has a stomach ache”). It was a wonderful time of
    life – our curiosity and our sense of discovery filled us with
    challenges.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our entire childhood was like a burst of lightning and
    an amusing upward learning pattern that cultivated our minds and fortified

        ><strong><u>Mental Exercises</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we said earlier, one way of keeping the brain healthy
    is by doing some mental exercises. If you do crosswords or calculate numbers
    in your head, that’s great, keep it up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; We’d also like to suggest the following that you can do
    whether in school, at the office, in the restaurant, in the parking lot,
    etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    <span class="text-huge"><i>Exercise 1: In School</i></span>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If your school cafeteria has a signboard describing the
    menu for that day, make an effort to read it in full and try to memorize the
    items on the menu. We tend to stare absent-mindedly at bulletin boards and
    not really absorb anything because the information is either irrelevant or
    unimportant. Make it a daily habit to read the menu and try to think of ways
    to remember what you read. For instance, if the menu has a list:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Quiche Lorraine</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Clam Chowder Soup</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Fish and Chips</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Vanilla Pudding, Chocolate Chip Cookies</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px"><span style="color: #4c4ce6">Herbal Tea</span></p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you read each item, imagine yourself eating these and
    identifying what each item tastes like. And try this: take the first letters
    of each item and keep repeating them to yourself. So you have QCFVH. Repeat:
    QCFVH. One more time: QCFVH. It’s no harder than memorizing the acronym of
    your favorite radio station, isn’t it?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If a fellow student ever asks, “hey, does anyone know
    what the cafeteria is serving today? I’m starving mad.” Be the first to tell
    him.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    <span class="text-huge"><i>Exercise 2: At the Office</i></span>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This should be a fun exercise if you’re into languages.
    You know the saying, it’s better to have two brains than one! Most bilingual
    people have an edge over their unilingual friends and associates. They
    stretch their brains and make them work harder as they find the equivalent
    word in a foreign language. In the US, Spanish is becoming the second most
    frequently used language while in Canada, it is French.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout the day, as you meet people and see objects
    in the company, think of the Spanish or French equivalent. For instance, you
    take a break and get up from your desk. You head for the washrooms. You see
    the following on your way
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Continue this exercise and watch your bilingual
    vocabulary grow. By putting the words into objects and persons you meet
    along your way, you are making a conscious effort to work your brain more.

        ><i>Exercise 3: In the Restaurant (or any public place)</i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can take a good look at your waiter (or waitress)
    and take in his features, any special moles, hand or eye movements, or if
    he’s got a ring on his finger. This is like practicing a bit of detective
    work, although it may not be a good exercise to do if you are dining with
    your spouse. Another exercise would be to look around the restaurant and
    make a guess as to how many customers there are. An alternative would be to
    spot unusual objects in the restaurant and pretend you’ve got a photographic
    mind and memorize their place. This way you sharpen your sense of vision and
    hearing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Making a conscious effort to know what is around you
    helps you define your place in relation to all the persons and objects that
    share the same space.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    <span class="text-huge"><i>Exercise 4: In the Parking Lot</i></span>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may have complained a few times about forgetting
    where you parked the car or getting the feeling that your car had been
    stolen. This happens frequently in a large shopping mall where the parking
    lots are located in different quadrants of the building. When you park your
    car, make a mental note of all possible “aid locators”: you’re in row #,
    facing a building (or highway or a large sign), the make and color of the
    car to your left and right, etc. This way, when you’re done with your
    shopping and ready to leave, you’ll know exactly where to go and what to
    look for. Instead of looking for your car in particular, you’ll be locating
    the signposts, buildings, and other cars that will help you pinpoint the
    location of your car.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By doing this exercise regularly, we’ll doubt you’ll be
    complaining about the same thing again!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A writer who shared a few mental exercises on a web site
    said that “any routine of exercises which causes you to think is of value.
    You will be amazed to find how quickly the mind will respond, and in a very
    short time you'll notice marked improvement in your ability to think
    quickly, logically and creatively.”
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This writer also suggested this exercise. While driving,
    concentrate on the license plate of the car ahead of you. Take the license
    number and reduce it to a single digit by adding all the digits together. If
    the result you obtain has more than one digit, add them. Continue the
    addition until you arrive at one digit. The writer provides the example
    below.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    978 = 9+7+8 = 24 = 2+4 = 6; 164 = 1+6+4 = 11 = 1+1 = 2;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">899 = 8+9+9 = 26 = 2+6 = 8</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you come across quizzes in newspapers and magazines,
    do them as well. After some time, you’ll discover how much faster your brain
    handles information.

    <span style="color: #4c4ce6"
        ><strong><u>Neurobics</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neurobics™ is a registered trademark involving a system
    of exercises for the brain. These exercises make use of all five physical
    senses as well as the emotional sense that are intended to inject life into
    your old routines. According to the professor who created this concept, Dr.
    Lawrence C. Katz, neurobics can be practiced anywhere and can be done for
    fun. These exercises can stimulate underused pathways and nerve connections,
    thus making your mind fit and flexible.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Katz based his exercises on findings obtained by
    neurobiology labs here and abroad. His reasoning is that just as individuals
    engage in fitness exercises to be fit and healthy, they can also perform
    exercises that will keep their minds vigorous and youthful as they grow
    older. He explains that brain cells develop by connecting with one another.
    The belief a decade ago was that these connections were only possible during
    childhood and young adulthood; new research suggests, however, that even in
    our maturing years, the brain still has that quality of re-wiring
    itself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since technology has “suppressed” the number of
    movements we make when doing a task (for example, the act of getting up to
    turn on the TV has now been replaced by a remote control), the different
    sensory structures of the brain have to be kept on “working mode”;
    otherwise, these abilities fade over time. Note that a large area of the
    brain processes information sent by all five senses. By doing some
    neurobics, we enable the brain to process these pieces of information more
    efficiently and more rapidly. A well-exercised brain trains us to remember
    names and dates more easily, learn a new computer skill or putting some
    creativity in our problem-solving and working lives.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A neurobic exercise, according to Dr. Katz, must involve
    more than one sense and used in a new way that would engage our attention
    and add a fresh component to our everyday routine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We’ll list some of the neurobic exercises that Dr. Katz
    recommends. It is what he calls “cross-training” our brain.

</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here’s a fun exercise. Shower with your eyes closed.
    With slow, deliberate movements, locate the shower handle, shampoo bottle
    and soap. Regulate the water temperature. Also, close your eyes as you get
    into the car and locate the ignition. By shutting your vision off, you allow
    your tactile sense to get to work.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Take in new smells and flavors. Instead of going to your
    usual supermarket, try an ethnic or farmer’s market. You will experience new
    sights and new aromas. Instead of Starbucks coffee, perhaps the Lebanese
    stall in the ethnic market has excellent coffee beans. Use your least active
    hand – the non-dominant one – to perform your daily rituals: combing,
    brushing your teeth, putting on make-up, zippering up, eating your cereals
    or toast, clicking on the mouse.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wake up to vanilla instead of freshly-brewed coffee. We
    all like to get out of bed and reach out for our first morning cup. Instead,
    we ought to try smelling something different aromas – peppermint, vanilla or
    cacao. Dr. Katz says that by linking a different aroma to our morning
    routine, we activate new pathways in our brain.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go to your local library and borrow a book on Braille.
    Dr. Katz recommends an exercise learning the Braille numbers for the various
    floors of your office or school building. You can also obtain Braille
    numbers information on Wikipedia.org.

        ><strong><u>Physical Fitness and Brain Health</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may have wondered about actual fitness exercises.
    Does being physically fit help the brain?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Definitely, says the Harvard article published for
    Women’s Health Watch. In laboratories using rodents for experiments,
    scientists have discovered that rodents who spend most of their time running
    on exercise wheels have better brains than their more sedentary mates.
    Similar studies in the past have not found any conclusive evidence that
    fitness improves brain functions, but a breakthrough study – the first of
    its kind – was conducted by the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign
    campus) wherein 55 subjects aged 55-79 were measured for their aerobic
    capacity during walking and treadmill tests. The subjects were a mixture of
    sedentary and physically active individuals. The conclusion, published in
    the Journal of Gerontology three years ago, revealed that “physically fit
    subjects had less age-related brain tissue shrinkage than less active
    subjects.” With the use of an MRI machine, researchers spotted distinct
    differences in the frontal, temporal and parietal regions of the brain –
    where tissues in these regions were vital for memory, learning and cell
    communication functions.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A related experiment also showed that aerobic fitness
    training largely influenced the cognitive abilities of women and men aged
    55-80. It was learned that exercise benefited human abilities such as
    attention, organization and planning, and that a combined program of
    aerobics and strength training were more effective than aerobics alone.
    Finally, it was also discovered that exercising for less than 30 minutes per
    session did not have any significant impact on cognitive functions.
