    >
</h2>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Writers who describe the brain tend to use the phrase
    “architecture of the brain.” We can see why. To use the term “architecture”
    suggests that like a skyscraper or an urban piece constituted of concrete
    slab, the brain is a complex system of beams, columns and walls that rests
    on the most fundamental elements of graph theory or plane geometry with a
    dozen or so engineering equations intertwined.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that’s too fancy for our taste. If we have to sound
    hip about the brain, we’d much rather compare it to the Los Angeles freeway
    during rush hour. Now that’s much better, isn’t it? You have movement,
    dynamism and complexity – so unlike a static architectural production, cold
    and unforgiving.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If a surgeon peeled off the skin and hair off a human
    being to expose his brain, we would probably reel and turn away from such a
    grotesque sight – lumps of raw ground beef held together by a fragile piece
    of glue. If we had the courage to look inside, however, we’d probably be
    entranced, marveling at how it does sort of resemble the LA freeway. To be
    able to see the brain in action would be like watching shooting stars and
    passing comets in the universe.

    <span style="color: #4c4ce6"
        ><strong><u>Peeking into the Brain</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you read about the brain, you’ll come across terms
    that you may have already learned in high school, so this section will be a
    quick review of the parts of the brain.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To better explain what the brain consists of and which
    parts are responsible for certain functions, we’ll take a hypothetical
    situation. Imagine that you’re in the cockpit of a 747, seated beside the
    chief pilot. In this scene, you are an invisible observer; the pilot does
    not know you’re there. He has an emergency situation to deal with but for as
    long as there is no immediate danger he sees no need to announce it to the
    passengers. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pilot has just received news that there
    is a deadly storm heading towards the aircraft. He has about 20 minutes to
    think of a set of maneuvers to either (a) avoid the path of the storm or (b)
    maintain his present course so he could land at the intended destination on
    time.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he communicates with the air traffic controllers, he
    begins to realize the seriousness of the situation and his mind literally
    goes on overdrive. There are 274 lives he is responsible for. The kinds of
    decisions he makes will either save those lives or cut them short. The
    traffic controller’s words were “you can try to weather the storm, but it
    has a wind velocity which we’re not sure the aircraft can withstand.”&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pilot’s brain goes to work. Right beneath each
    statement is the part of the brain that’s working (in bold) as he’s thinking
    and deciding – and reacting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pilot is informed he’s got 20 minutes to make a
    decision: he either changes his trajectory completely or stays the course
    hoping the aircraft is strong enough to withstand battering from the storm.
    He’s breathing faster and his heart rate is pounding:
    <strong>HINDBRAIN</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He steers the plane a little to the left, presses some
    controls on the panel to increase altitude. He does these steps almost by
    rote: <strong>CEREBELLUM (located in the hindbrain)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes are focused in the vast darkness before him. He
    blinks constantly making sure his path is clear: <strong>MIDBRAIN</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At this point, the pilot is analyzing his fuel capacity.
    If he changes trajectory to avoid the storm completely, that means a three
    hour delay. Does he have sufficient fuel? His mind races as he tries to
    remember other emergency procedures. What are the pros and cons? He recalled
    a fellow pilot who had to make the same kind of decision and almost didn’t
    make it: <strong>FOREBRAIN</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pilot is now arguing with himself. He keeps saying “what
    if” and then answers it himself. His abstract reasoning has never been this
    sharp before. These emergencies are making him think at double the speed.
    Looking for answers…imagining the alternatives…evaluating scenario A versus
    scenario B: <strong>RIGHT HEMISPHERE (located in the cerebrum)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pilot re-establishes communication with air traffic
    control. “I’ll change course.” He outlines his plan in detail, talks to the
    control tower and assures them he has sufficient fuel:
    <strong>LEFT HEMISPHERE (located in the cerebrum)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pilot thinks about his wife back home. If he doesn’t
    make it, did he update his will? If he makes it, he’ll ask for a month’s
    leave, take his wife to the Caribbean for a much needed vacation. It’s been
    a heck of a month, he says to himself. They hardly saw each other. Is she
    seeing someone else? <strong>FRONTAL LOBE</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two hours and twenty minutes later, pilot taxis into
    runway 8B. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome home. We apologize for the delay.
    We needed to change direction because of a storm brewing over Hokkaido
    Island in Japan. We’ll be pleased to make alternatives for those who have
    been inconvenienced by this delay. Thank you for flying with Brainwave
    Airlines, your thinking airline.”

    />Pilot walks into the pilot executive lounge and is greeted by a warm round
    of applause. “What’s this, he asks. “Your reward for thinking and planning
    well”, says his boss. Someone told us you love sushi and kimchi – well,
    here’s a plate. No charge. Enjoy it.” His colleagues shake his hand as they
    exit the lounge saying “well done, kiddo. Thank goodness, cabin air didn’t
    shrink your brain. Brilliant maneuvering!” Seeing the sushi, he had almost
    forgotten how famished he was. He sat down and devoured the meal, relishing
    every morsel. The best meal he’s had in months!
    <strong>PARIETAL LOBE</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he drives to his hotel, he made a note that he’d have
    to reconstruct the events of the night and input it into the database of the
    emergency manual for pilots. He’ll do that first thing in the morning while
    it’s still fresh in his mind and can remember every detail and maneuver he
    executed in the last three hours: <strong>HIPPOCAMPUS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;End of film clip. Let’s summarize what we’ve just
    learned about the components of the brain.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One incontestable fact we must accept: the brain is the
    most complex part of the human body. We’d like to add our bit: some brains
    are more complex than others; this is why we have individuals who are more
    complicated than others and hence difficult to understand.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The brain weighs only three pounds but this lightweight
    mass holds our intelligence, puts some sense to all five senses, sets our
    bodies in motion and directs our behavior. Taking all the brains of our
    fellow human beings and putting them together would enable us to define
    civilization and encapsulate the story of humanity.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since much knowledge has been gained from the study of
    the brain in the last two to three decades, Steven Pinker says that the
    United States government thought it appropriate to designate the 1990s as
    the Decade of the Brain. He quips, “But there will never be a Decade of the
    Pancreas.”[4] This is because the brain enjoys special status. That special
    status resides in the brain’s ability to make humans see, feel, think,
    choose and act – and calls it information processing.
</p>
<p>
    Just as the cell is the basic unit of human life, the brain is made up of
    three major units:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160px; text-align: center">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Forebrain</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160px; text-align: center">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Midbrain</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160px; text-align: center">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Hindbrain</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160px; text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Forebrain</strong> - this is the most highly
    developed section of the brain. It contains the cerebrum and other
    structures. When people look at pictures of the brain, the first thing they
    usually see is the cerebrum which is located at the top of the brain where
    most of a person’s intellectual activities come from. It houses your
    memories, makes you capable of planning, imagining and thinking. It is the
    part that assists you in recognizing your friends and family, enjoying a
    movie and playing solitaire.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Midbrain</strong> – this is located in the
    topmost part of the brainstem and controls our eye movements and other
    voluntary movements. If you recall our film clip, when the pilot kept
    blinking his eyes to look out in the dark skies and adjusting his glasses,
    his midbrain was called to task.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Hindrain</strong> – you will find the hindbrain
    right above your spinal cord. This is where the cerebellum is located. It
    resembles a wrinkled ball of tissue. It is the hindbrain that directs the
    body’s respiratory and heart rates. It coordinates bodily reflexes and is
    also responsible for movements you make automatically or by rote. For
    example, when you play the violin or run a marathon, the cerebellum located
    in the hindbrain goes to work.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking deeper into the brain, we now focus on the
    cerebrum which has two hemispheres. As we said earlier, the cerebrum is
    located in the forebrain. These hemispheres are separated by a deep dividing
    line; this division does not prevent the two hemispheres from sending
    messages to and from each other. They look similar in appearance but differ
    in their functions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6"
        ><strong><u>Hemispheres of the Brain</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Left hemisphere</strong> – when an individual
    utters words, it is the left hemisphere that is working.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Right hemisphere</strong> – when an individual
    engages in abstract reasoning or logic, it is the right hemisphere that
    enables him to practice these skills.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The brain and the body send signals to each other and
    when they do, these signals cross over. This means that the right hemisphere
    controls the left side of the body, while the left hemisphere controls the
    right side. Therefore, when one side of the brain is affected or is hurt,
    the opposite side of the body is affected. To put it more clearly, if an
    individual has had a stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain, his left
    arm and leg are paralyzed.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we explore our thoughts and how they get processed in
    the brain, we will need to know about the brain’s other components. Note
    that each hemisphere is divided into sections – more commonly called lobes.
    These lobes – frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal - have their own
    respective functions.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Frontal lobes</strong> – there are two frontal
    lobes located behind the forehead. When you sit down and make a shopping
    list, plan an itinerary or argue with your boss, these are the two lobes
    that enable you to perform these functions. The frontal lobes are what the
    Neurological Institute of the NIH calls a “shortterm storage site”; that is,
    keeping one idea on standby while you weigh other ideas. The left frontal
    lobe is where you’ll find Broca’s area, which processes your thoughts into
    words.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Parietal lobes</strong> – remember our airline
    pilot who loved sushi and kimchi? When he ate every bite and cleaned out his
    plate, his parietal lobes were at work. The pilot’s smell, texture and taste
    for sushi were processed by his parietal lobes and more specifically by the
    primary sensory areas. These areas are information receptors especially when
    the information has to do with temperature, touch and taste. The parietal
    lobes, however, are not limited to taste and smell but also process reading
    and arithmetic functions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Occipital lobes</strong> – these lobes are
    located at the back of the brain. They receive images that the eyes see and
    send those images to be stored in the memory. If the occipital lobes are
    damaged, blindness can occur.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Temporal lobes</strong> – these are found in the
    visual areas of the brain and are located just underneath the parietal and
    frontal lobes. Are you a fan of Eminem? Do you swoon over Tom Jones when he
    sings “What’s New Pussycat?” Your temporal lobes are at work. The temporal
    lobes process information received by the ears; these lobes contribute to
    memory functions – including anything to do with music, as well as
    sensations associated with taste, sound, light and touch.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Venturing into the deeper recesses of the brain, we find
    three distinct components:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px; text-align: center">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Hypothalamus</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px; text-align: center">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Thalamus</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px; text-align: center">
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6">Hippocampus</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 120px; text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The NIH describes these three parts as the “gatekeepers”
    that lie in between the spinal cord and the hemispheres of the brain. These
    three elements orchestrate our emotions and the manner in which we respond
    to such emotions.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Hypothalamus</strong> – this serves as the
    center of vital functions. It drags you out of bed, makes you nervous and
    your hands clammy when you’re about to break the news to your parents that
    you failed Physics, and it works every time you’re ecstatic, frustrated or
    raving mad.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Thalamus</strong> – the thalamus is located
    close to the hypothalamus and acts as a traffic coordinator between data to
    and from the spinal cord and the cerebrum.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Hippocampus</strong> – this component is small
    in size and yet acts as a warehouse of memories. It’s like the hard disk of
    your computer. It stores your files and then when you need them, retrieves
    them for you. It also has nerve cells that come in clusters called basal
    ganglia, responsible for triggering movement.

<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No discussion on the brain is complete without
    mentioning neurotransmitters. These are the chemical messengers of the brain
    that carry thoughts back and forth from cell to cell. The health of our
    brain depends to a significant degree on the proper balance of
    neurotransmitters. So when people are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, it means
    that there is widespread death of brain cells. The brain is flesh and blood.
    This is one thing that people have to remember. It is NOT the mind. The
    brain is the organ and like any organ of the body, it needs nutrition and
    rest. The mind is WHO we are – the software that carries out the functions
    of the hardware – the brain.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
    <span style="color: #4c4ce6"
        ><strong><u>Brain Neurotransmitters</u></strong></span
    >
</h4>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Acetylcholine</strong> – this substance is the
    principal memory carrier. People with Alzheimer’s show lower levels of
    acetylcholine. It dictates if our muscles have to contract or make our
    glands secrete hormones.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>GABA</strong> – this is gamma-aminobutyric acid
    and is referred to as a neurotransmitter that inhibits because it calms down
    cells. It regulates muscle movements and is an essential part of the visual
    system. Epileptic and Huntington patients usually take drugs to increase
    GABA levels in the brain.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Serotonin</strong> – this is another inhibitory
    neurotransmitter that acts on blood vessels and promotes sleep and regulates
    the body’s temperature. Together with norepinephrine, it keeps individuals
    in a good mood. It is therefore likely that crankiness in older men and
    women have a biological basis. Out of 40 million Americans aged sixty five
    and older, more than six million could be candidates for depression, and
    most of them consider it as part of the aging process. Dr. Khalsa, however,
    says that it is possible to overcome shortages of these mood
    neurotransmitters through nutritional and pharmacological solutions.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Dopamine</strong> – another neurotransmitter
    that influences mood and body reflexes. Examples of low dopamine levels are
    seen in Parkinson’s patients who suffer from rigid muscles and lose control
    over their movements. This indicates that dopamine levels have decreased in
    some segments of the brain.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists have discovered at least 100
    neurotransmitters and they all have their individual chemical activities.
    The above are some of the key neurotransmitters that preserve some of the
    more important functions of the brain.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the next Chapter, we’ll talk about how to keep the
    brain healthy, banishing the myth that it can potentially “disintegrate”
    with age.
</p>
