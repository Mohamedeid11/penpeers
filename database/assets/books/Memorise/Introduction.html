<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As we drove by Starbucks one day, we couldn’t help but
    chuckle. Starbucks Café reminded us of two stories that we’ve tucked safely
    in our memory: one story is about a young fellow who is a ghost writer and
    likes to bring along his lap top to the café where he could type away and
    gulp down mugs of his favorite cup of coffee – Americano, he called it.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You can’t blame me, it’s soooooo good”, he’d say, and
    we felt compelled one day to warn him not to leave his lap top unattended
    when he went up to the counter to order his Americano, and to be careful
    about not spilling his Americano into his lap top. A ghostwriter could not
    afford to lose pages of written work. It would be difficult to reconstruct
    what he’s written. Even with a photographic memory, he could not re-create
    the original. He’d have to start all over again.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The other story is that of a book written by a Dr. Dharma
    Singh Khalsa which he appropriately titled Brain Longevity. He trained in
    Creighton University School of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and the
    University of California in San Francisco. He is a diplomate of the American
    Board of Anesthesiology and member and secretary of the American Academy of
    AntiAging Medicine.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Brain Longevity, Dr. Khalsa talked about patients in
    their 40s and 50s who would come to his office in a state of anxiety
    convinced that they were sure candidates for Alzheimer’s. When he asked them
    why they believed that, they’d say that they’re constantly forgetting
    things, not able to digest a brief as easily as when they were younger,
    alarmed that they couldn’t remember names, and regularly misplacing car
    keys. What worried them more, however, was the decline in their mental
    alertness.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of his patients admitted, quite embarrassed, that
    his daughter’s soccer team asked him to stop being their referee because he
    was forgetting who last touched the ball when it went bouncing off. He was
    calling out scores that didn’t make sense and his daughter, who was feeling
    the pressure from her team mates, had to ask him to give up his position as
    referee.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The frequent complaint was their “fuzzy brains.”
    Neurologists have a name for it. It’s called “age-associated memory
    impairment”, a condition that is most common among people aged fifty and
    older. As Dr. Khalsa said, it is normal to lose brain capacity at 50 just as
    it is normal to experience diminishing eyesight at age 40.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is a generation of frightened baby boomers, Dr.
    Khalsa says. All of a sudden they’re losing their “endocrinological spark as
    their youth hormones dry up and sexual urges are flattening out. They’re
    gaining weight, losing muscle and hair, and needing more and stronger coffee
    just to slog through the day. The boomers’ loss was Starbucks’ gain.”
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Grin and bear it, if we should, but an increasing number
    of scientists – including Dr. Khalsa - believe that it is possible to defy
    the mental aging process. People in their 40s, 50s and 60s can have not only
    a perfect memory but also brain power.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">The brain is a dynamic organ</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Individuals who get older can retain their youthful
    minds so that their learning ability, creativity and emotional vigor remain
    intact. They are able to sustain the mental dexterity and sharpness they
    need as they reach their 70s and 80s.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Charles M. Schultz, the famous Peanuts creator once said
    that “life is like a ten-speed bicycle. Most of us have gears we never use.”
    We’ll disagree with this dithyramb a little. It’s not so much life having
    all these gears, but the mind. The mind possesses faculties that some people
    have not bothered about. We’ve heard of cases where individuals with
    exceptionally high IQs consistently fail in life. We tend to dismiss them as
    “intellectually lazy” beings who never harnessed the full power of their
    minds.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or else we’ve heard of the oft-repeated complaint, “he’s
    got all sorts of PhDs up his sleeve, but he’s completely bereft of common
    sense.”
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">The mind is a mysterious abyss</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What kind of mental make-up drives someone to open fire
    in a school cafeteria and shoot aimlessly at human beings with minds that
    one day would rule the earth? What happens to the creativity of a university
    freshman who decides to major in Quantum Physics even if his first love is
    music? How does a spelling bee champion remember the sequence of letters in
    a word like bacillus thuringiensis?
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    Or, as the songwriter asked, why do fools fall in love?
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was quite a mouthful that Steven Pinker wrote in
    How the Mind Works (1997). His book had 565 pages (small characters), 565
    footnotes plus our rough estimate of 380 references. His main thesis focused
    on the human mind and the theories of evolution and computation. No wonder
    he teaches at noble institutions like Harvard and MIT. How much gray matter
    does a man like Pinker possess? More importantly, would you date him?
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Knowing his intellectual prowess, you’d probably hesitate.
    You’d cringe in fear and dread to think that you could even engage in a
    mental sparring of sorts with him.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet scientists and zealous believers think that each of
    us has the innate ability to imitate a Pinker or a Darwin or a Christian
    Barnard if we wanted to. How much brain power – we prefer to call it
    horsepower – would we need to produce a 500-page treatise on the
    reproductive cycle of a chironomid or take out a healthy heart and
    transplant it on someone else?
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We’ll begin in first base. We’ll map the brain for you
    in the next Chapter and how each area of the brain corresponds to something.
    We’ll look at the hemispheres of the brain and what they’re supposed to do
    for us, including a peek into neutron-transmitters.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Chapter Three, we’ll ask ourselves the question, “How
    do we keep the brain healthy and how do mental and physical exercises whip
    our brains into shape? Memory – that elusive asset we’re all supposed to
    possess – will be discussed in Chapter Four. Brain nutrition is tackled in
    Chapter Five where we look at certain foods for nourishment and see how
    fats, carbohydrates and micronutrients help the brain acquire more agility.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some chapters will discuss mental processes – creative,
    critical and analytical thinking - and what exercises we can engage in to
    improve these processes. The role of aromatherapy in brain health will also
    be discussed (Chapter Nine), as well as the practices of visualization,
    meditation and streaming (chapters ten, eleven and twelve).
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We’ll revisit speed reading in Chapter Thirteen and then
    take the back seat as we linger back in history and examine a few of the
    greatest thinkers.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We’ll wrap up the e-book with worksheets that you can
    use for waking up your brain and bringing out the colors of the mind.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People love to say that the brain is a muscle and
    therefore needs to be stretched. There are specific exercises to help us
    with this task.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And maybe – just maybe – we’ll be able to answer the question
    of why fools in love.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In the meantime, let’s look inside the brain – yours and mine
    – and find proof that we too can join the ranks of great achievers one day.
    After all, as Donald Trump used to say, “as long as you’re going to be
    thinking anyway, think big.”
