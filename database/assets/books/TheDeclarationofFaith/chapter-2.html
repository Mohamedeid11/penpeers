        >It has great virtues and has a great place with Allaah. Whoever says it with truthfulness will enter the Gardens of Paradise and whoever did not utter it truthfully, his property and blood will be safeguarded in this world, but his reckoning will be with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. It is a concise declaration
        that contains few letters; light upon the tongue, yet heavy in the scales. It has been reported by Ibn Hibbaan, as well as al-Haakim who declared it to be authentic (saheeh), from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudree <i>radhiya</i> <i>allahu anhu</i>, that Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallahu alaihi wasallam </i>said: “<strong>Moses said: 0 my Lord! Teach me something by which I can remember You and supplicate to You. Allaah said: 0 Moses! say laa ilaaha ilallaah. Moses said: 0 my Lord! All Your slaves say this. Allaah said: 0 Moses! If the seven heavens andall that they contain, other than Me, and the seven earths were placed in one scale, and laa ilaahailallaah were put in the other, then laa ilaaha illallaah would outweigh them all.” </strong

As for one who can acquire cognizance of Allaah without contemplation, norhas his fitrah been corrupted, then it is not obligatory upon him.”</span
