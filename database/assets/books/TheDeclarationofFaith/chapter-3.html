        >It has two pillars: The first pillar is the pillar of negation(nafee), whilst the second is the pillar of affirmation (ithbaat). What is meant by negation is to negate divinity and worship (ilaahiyyah) for anything except Allaah, the Highest. What is
        meant by affirmation is to affirm divinity and worship only for Allaah the Most Perfect; for it is He alone thatis the true Deity. So whatever else is taken by the unbelievers asdeities to be worshiped are in fact all false and futile:</span>

        >Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim said: “The significance of laa ilaaha illaltaah in affirming divinity and worship for only Allaah is far greater than just saying that Allaah is an ilaah. This is because the saying that Allaah is an ilaah does not negate divinity and worship to other than Allaah. This is different to the saying: laa ilaaha illallaah; which obligates restricting divinity and worship to only Allaah. Likewise, those who explain al-Ilaah to mean: Theone who has the ability to create and originate (al-qaadir ‘alaalikhtiraa’) have, for sure, committed a grave error.</span>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif">
        Shaykh Sulaymaan ibn ‘Abdullaah said in his explanation to Kitaabut-Tawheed: “Ifit is said: The meaning of deity (ilaah) and divinity (ilaahiyyah) have been clarified, but what is the reply to those who say that the meaning of al-Ilaah is: The one who has the ability to create and originate; or other such similar expressions?  Then the answer to this is from two angles: -
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif"
        >Firstly: That this saying is a newly-invented saying which none of the scholars, nor any of the leading linguists, have ever advocated; rather the words of the scholars and linguists agree with what we have previously mentioned. Therefore, this view is false.</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif">Secondly: Even if this is accepted, then it is only an explanation of what is essential for a true ilaah. Indeed, it is essential that the true ilaah be a Creator who is capable of creating and originating. If this is not the case, then that is not the true ilaah, even if he is called this. It certainly does not mean that whoever realizes that ilaah means the one who is capable of creating and originating, that such a person has entered into Islaam .</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif">No one has ever said this, since it would imply that the Arab unbelievers would have to be considered as Muslims</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style', serif">The Shaykh said in Bayaan Haqeeqatut-Tawheed (p.19): “Some of them explain ilaah to mean: the One that has the ability to originate and create. So, the meaning of laa ilaaha illallaahin their view is: None has the ability to originate and create, except Allaah; and this is a serious error! For whoever explains [the kalimah] to mean just this, has not affirmed anything different than what the unbelievers already affirmed. They used to affirm that none has the ability to originate, nor to create, nor to provide and sustain, nor to give life, nor to cause death, except for Allaah</span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style', serif">- just as Allaah, the Exalted, mentions about them. Yet He did not declare them to be Muslims [because of this belief]. Yes, this meaning that is mentioned, enters into the [overall] meaning of laa ilaaha illallaah. However, it is not the main implication of this kalimah.”</span>

        >Thus, he acknowledged that Lordship (ruboobiyyah) belongs to Allaah alone and he [even] took an oath by Allaah’s
        Might. The same is the case for the rest of the unbelievers who also acknowledged this; such as Aboo Jahl and Aboo Lahab and other
        leaders of unbelief who opposed [the Prophet]. They all acknowledged that Lordship belongs to Allaah alone - along with the fact that they were unbelievers and misguided. Allaah the Majestic said [about such unbelievers]:</span>

<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style', serif">So, they acknowledged all of this, along with the fact that in times of difficulty and hardship they would supplicate exclusively to Allaah alone. This is because they knew that there can be no salvation from difficulty except with Allaah the Most Perfect; knowing [also] that their deities and idols had no power at all to save them from [any] destruction. Allaah the Exalted said [about them]:</span>

        So, whoever acknowledges [just] this type of tawheed, has not entered into Islaam nor will he be saved from the Hellfire. The unbelievers - as an example - acknowledged and affirmed tawheed ar-ruboobiyyah, yet their acknowledgement of it did not make them Muslims. Rather, Allaah [still] called them idol- worshippers (mushriks) and unbelievers (kuffaar) and the ruling upon them was that they would be consigned to the Hellfire for eternity; even with their acknowledgement of tawheed ar- ruboobiyyah!
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style', serif">
        From this can be seen the mistake of those who - because of adopting the way of the rationalists (ahlul-kalaam) in their writings concerning [Islaamic] beliefs - explain tawheed as [merely] being the affirmation that Allaahexists and that He is the sole Creator, Sustainer, etc. So, we say to them: This is not the belief with which Allaah sent the Prophets, since the mushriks and the unbelievers - and indeed,even lb lees - already affirmed [the concept of] tawheed ar-ruboobiyyah.”
    </span>
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style', serif">
        Imaam Ibn Abil-’Izz, rahimahullaah, said in Sharhul-’Aqeedatit- Taahawiyyah (1/28-29): “The tawheed to which the Messengers called and for which the Scriptures were revealed is tawheedul- ilaahiyyah; that Allaah alone has the right to be worshiped, without ascribing any partner to Him in this; and this encompasses tawheed ar-ruboobiyyah. Indeed the Arab mushriks used to acknowledge tawheed ar-ruboobiyyah  and  that  the Creator of the heavens and the earth was One.”

    <span style="font-family: 'Bookman Old Style', serif">
        Finally, Imaam at-Tabaree relates in Jaami’ul-Bayaan ‘an Ta’weelil Qur’aan (13/50-51) that Ibn ‘Abbaas radiallaahu “anhu said: “If you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will reply: Allaah.
