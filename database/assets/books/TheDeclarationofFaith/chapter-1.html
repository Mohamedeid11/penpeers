        >Indeed all praise is for Allaah. We praise Him; seek His aid and
        assistance; and seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allaah fromthe
        evil [whisperings] to our souls and from our own evil actions. Whosoever
        Allaah guides, none can misguide; but whosoever Allaah leaves to stray,
        none can guide aright. I bear witness that none has the right to be
        worshiped except Allaah alone, Whohas no partner; and I bear witness
        that Muhammad <i>sallallahu alaihi wasallam</i>, is His Slave and
        Messenger.</span

        commanded us to remember Him in general, and more particularly, after
        completing the various prescribed acts of worship. Allaah the Exalted

        rather it has certain rulings, conditions, meanings and requirements
        attached to it - I decided to choose this kalimah as the subject of my

        in accordance with its requirements, both inwardly and outwardly.</span
