        >I’d done a lot of dumb and dangerous things in my life, but soliciting
        a ride with a stranger was not yet one of them. Horrible things happened
        to hitchhikers, I knew, especially to women hitchhiking alone. They were
        raped and decapitated. Tortured and left for dead. But as I made my way
        from White’s Motel to the nearby gas station, I could not allow such
        thoughts to distract me. Unless I wanted to walk twelve miles along the
        broiling shoulder of the highway to reach the trail, I needed a ride.
        Plus, hitchhiking was simply what PCT hikers did on occasion. And I was
        a PCT hiker, right? Right? Right. The Pacific Crest Trail, Volume 1:
        California had explained the process with its usual equanimity. On some
        occasions the PCT would cross a road and miles down that road would be
        the post office where one would have mailed the box of food and supplies
        needed on the next section of the trail. Hitchhiking was the only
        practical solution when it came to fetching those boxes and returning to
        the trail. I stood near the soda machines up against the gas station
        building, watching people come and go, trying to work up the nerve to
        approach one of them, hoping I’d sense that I was safe from harm when I
        saw the right person. I watched old desert-grizzled men in cowboy hats
        and families whose cars were full already and teenagers who pulled up
        with music blasting out their open windows. Nobody in particular looked
        like a murderer or rapist, but nobody in particular didn’t look like one
        either. I bought a can of Coke and drank it with a casual air that
        belied the fact that I could not stand up properly because of the
        unbelievable weight on my back. Finally, I had to make a move. It was
        nearly eleven, pitching steadily into the heat of a June day in the
        desert. A minivan with Colorado plates pulled up and two men got out.
        One man was about my age, the other looked to be in his fifties. I
        approached them and asked for a ride. They hesitated and glanced at each
        other, their expressions making it apparent that they were united in
        their silent search for a reason to say no, so I kept talking,
        explaining in quick bursts about the PCT. “Sure,” the older one said
        finally, with obvious reluctance. “Thank you,” I trilled girlishly. When
        I hobbled toward the big door on the side of the van, the younger man
        rolled it open for me. I gazed inside, realizing suddenly that I had no
        idea how to get in. I couldn’t even attempt to step up into it with my
        pack on. I’d have to take my pack off, and yet how? If I undid the
        buckles that held the backpack’s straps around my waist and over my
        shoulders, there would be no way that I could keep it from falling so
        violently away from me that it might rip my arms off. “You need a hand?”
        the young man asked. “No. I’ve got it,” I said in a falsely unruffled
        tone. The only thing I could think to do was turn my back to the van and
        squat to sit on the doorframe while clutching the edge of the sliding
        door, letting my pack rest on the floor behind me. It was bliss. I
        unclipped my pack’s straps and carefully extricated myself without
        tipping my pack over and then turned to climb inside the van to sit
        beside it. The men were friendlier to me once we were on our way,
        driving west through an arid landscape of parched-looking bushes and
        pale mountains stretching off into the distance. They were a father and
        son from a suburb of Denver, on their way to a graduation ceremony in
        San Luis Obispo. Before long, a sign announcing Tehachapi Pass appeared
        and the older man slowed the van and pulled to the side of the road. The
        younger man got out and slid the big door open for me. I’d hoped to put
        my pack on the same way I’d taken it off, aided by the height of the
        van’s floor as I squatted in the doorway, but before I could step out,
        the man pulled out my pack and dropped it heavily in the gravelly dirt
        by the side of the road. It fell so hard I feared my dromedary bag would
        burst. I climbed out after it and pulled it back to standing position
        and dusted it off. “Are you sure you can lift that?” he asked. “ ’Cause
        I barely can.” “Of course I can lift it,” I said. He stood there, as if
        waiting for me to prove it. “Thanks for the ride,” I said, wanting him
        to leave, so he wouldn’t be witness to my humiliating pack-donning
        routine. He nodded and slid the van’s door shut. “Be safe out there.” “I
        will,” I said, and watched him get back in the van. I stood by the
        silent highway after they drove away. Small clouds of dust blew in
        swirling gusts beneath the glaring noon sun. I was at an elevation of
        nearly 3,800 feet, surrounded in all directions by beige, barren-looking
        mountains dotted with clusters of sagebrush, Joshua trees, and
        waist-high chaparral. I was standing at the western edge of the Mojave
        Desert and at the southern foot of the Sierra Nevada, the vast mountain
        range that stretched north for more than four hundred miles to Lassen
        Volcanic National Park, where it connected with the Cascade Range, which
        extended from northern California all the way through Oregon and
        Washington and beyond the Canadian border. Those two mountain ranges
        would be my world for the next three months; their crest, my home. On a
        fence post beyond the ditch I spied a palm-sized metal blaze that said
        PACIFIC CREST TRAIL. I was here. I could begin at last. It occurred to
        me that now would be the perfect time to take a photograph, but to
        unpack the camera would entail such a series of gear and bungee cord
        removals that I didn’t even want to attempt it. Plus, in order to get
        myself in the picture, I’d have to find something to prop the camera on
        so I could set its timer and get into place before it took the shot, and
        nothing around me looked too promising. Even the fence post that the PCT
        blaze was attached to seemed too desiccated and frail. Instead, I sat
        down in the dirt in front of my pack, the same way I’d done in the motel
        room, wrested it onto my shoulders, and then hurled myself onto my hands
        and knees and did my dead lift to stand. Elated, nervous, hunching in a
        remotely upright position, I buckled and cinched my pack and staggered
        the first steps down the trail to a brown metal box that was tacked to
        another fence post. When I lifted the lid, I saw a notebook and pen
        inside. It was the trail register, which I’d read about in my guidebook.
        I wrote my name and the date and read the names and notes from the
        hikers who’d passed through in the weeks ahead of me, most of them men
        traveling in pairs, not one of them a woman alone. I lingered a bit
        longer, feeling a swell of emotion over the occasion, and then I
        realized there was nothing to do but go, so I did. The trail headed
        east, paralleling the highway for a while, dipping down into rocky
        washes and back up again. I’m hiking! I thought. And then, I am hiking
        on the Pacific Crest Trail. It was this very act, of hiking, that had
        been at the heart of my belief that such a trip was a reasonable
        endeavor. What is hiking but walking, after all? I can walk! I’d argued
        when Paul had expressed his concern about my never actually having gone
        backpacking. I walked all the time. I walked for hours on end in my work
        as a waitress. I walked around the cities I lived in and visited. I
        walked for pleasure and purpose. All of these things were true. But
        after about fifteen minutes of walking on the PCT, it was clear that I
        had never walked into desert mountains in early June with a pack that
        weighed significantly more than half of what I did strapped onto my
        back. Which, it turns out, is not very much like walking at all. Which,
        in fact, resembles walking less than it does hell. I began panting and
        sweating immediately, dust caking my boots and calves as the trail
        turned north and began to climb rather than undulate. Each step was a
        toil, as I ascended higher and higher still, interrupted only by the
        occasional short descent, which was not so much a break in the hell as
        it was a new kind of hell because I had to brace myself against each
        step, lest gravity’s pull cause me, with my tremendous, uncontrollable
        weight, to catapult forward and fall. I felt like the pack was not so
        much attached to me as me to it. Like I was a building with limbs,
        unmoored from my foundation, careening through the wilderness. Within
        forty minutes, the voice inside my head was screaming, What have I
        gotten myself into? I tried to ignore it, to hum as I hiked, though
        humming proved too difficult to do while also panting and moaning in
        agony and trying to remain hunched in that remotely upright position
        while also propelling myself forward when I felt like a building with
        legs. So then I tried to simply concentrate on what I heard—my feet
        thudding against the dry and rocky trail, the brittle leaves and
        branches of the low-lying bushes I passed clattering in the hot wind—but
        it could not be done. The clamor of What have I gotten myself into? was
        a mighty shout. It could not be drowned out. The only possible
        distraction was my vigilant search for rattlesnakes. I expected one
        around every bend, ready to strike. The landscape was made for them, it
        seemed. And also for mountain lions and wilderness-savvy serial killers.
        But I wasn’t thinking of them. It was a deal I’d made with myself months
        before and the only thing that allowed me to hike alone. I knew that if
        I allowed fear to overtake me, my journey was doomed. Fear, to a great
        extent, is born of a story we tell ourselves, and so I chose to tell
        myself a different story from the one women are told. I decided I was
        safe. I was strong. I was brave. Nothing could vanquish me. Insisting on
        this story was a form of mind control, but for the most part, it worked.
        Every time I heard a sound of unknown origin or felt something horrible
        cohering in my imagination, I pushed it away. I simply did not let
        myself become afraid. Fear begets fear. Power begets power. I willed
        myself to beget power. And it wasn’t long before I actually wasn’t
        afraid. I was working too hard to be afraid. I took one step and then
        another, moving along at barely more than a crawl. I hadn’t thought that
        hiking the PCT would be easy. I’d known it would take some getting
        adjusted. But now that I was out here, I was less sure I would adjust.
        Hiking the PCT was different than I’d imagined. I was different than I’d
        imagined. I couldn’t even remember what it was I’d imagined six months
        ago, back in December, when I’d first decided to do this. I’d been
        driving on a stretch of highway east of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, when
        the idea came to me. I’d driven to Sioux Falls from Minneapolis the day
        before with my friend Aimee to retrieve my truck, which had been left
        there the week before when it broke down while a friend was borrowing
        it. By the time Aimee and I arrived in Sioux Falls, my truck had been
        towed from the street. Now it was in a lot surrounded by a chain-link
        fence and buried in snow from the blizzard that had passed through a
        couple of days before. It had been for this blizzard that I’d gone to
        REI the previous day to purchase a shovel. As I waited in line to pay
        for it, I’d spotted a guidebook about something called the Pacific Crest
        Trail. I picked it up and studied its cover and read the back before
        returning it to its place on the shelf. Once Aimee and I had cleared the
        snow away from my truck that day in Sioux Falls, I got inside and turned
        the key. I assumed I’d hear nothing but that dead clicking sound that
        automobiles make when they’ve got nothing left to give you, but it
        started right up. We could’ve driven back to Minneapolis then, but we
        decided to check into a motel for the night instead. We went out to a
        Mexican restaurant for an early dinner, elated with the unexpected ease
        of our journey. As we ate chips and salsa and drank margaritas, I got a
        funny feeling in my gut. “It’s like I swallowed the chips whole,” I told
        Aimee, “like the edges are still intact and jabbing me inside.” I felt
        full and tingly down low, like I’d never felt before. “Maybe I’m
        pregnant,” I joked, and then the moment I said it, I realized I wasn’t
        joking. “Are you?” asked Aimee. “I could be,” I said, suddenly
        terrified. I’d had sex a few weeks before with a man named Joe. I’d met
        him the previous summer in Portland, when I’d gone there to visit Lisa
        and escape my troubles. I’d been there only a few days when he’d walked
        up to me in a bar and put his hand on my wrist. “Nice,” he said,
        outlining the sharp edges of my tin bracelet with his fingers. He had
        neon punk-rock hair cut close to the scalp and a garish tattoo that
        covered half his arm, though his face was in precise contradiction to
        those disguises: tenacious and tender—like a kitten wanting milk. He was
        twenty-four and I was twenty-five. I hadn’t slept with anyone since Paul
        and I had broken up three months before. That night we had sex on Joe’s
        lumpy futon on the floor and barely slept, talking until the sun rose,
        mostly about him. He told me about his smart mother and his alcoholic
        father and the fancy and rigorous school where he’d earned his BA the
        year before. “Have you ever tried heroin?” he asked in the morning. I
        shook my head and laughed idly. “Should I?” I could’ve let it drop. Joe
        had only just started using it when he met me. It was something he did
        separate from me, with a group of friends he’d made whom I didn’t know.
        I could’ve glided right past it, but something compelled me to pause
        instead. I was intrigued. I was unattached. In my youth and sorrow, I
        was ready to self-destruct. So I didn’t just say yes to heroin. I pulled
        it in with both hands.

        >I was cuddled up with Joe, postsex, on his ratty couch the first time I
        used it, a week after we’d met. We took turns sucking up the smoke from
        a burning dab of black tar heroin that sat on a sheet of aluminum foil
        through a pipe that was made of foil too. Within a few days, I wasn’t in
        Portland to visit Lisa and escape my sorrows anymore. I was in Portland
        falling into a drug-fueled half love with Joe. I moved into his
        apartment above an abandoned drugstore, where we spent most of the
        summer having adventuresome sex and doing heroin. In the beginning, it
        was a few times a week, then it was every couple of days, then it was
        every day. First we smoked it, then we snorted it. But we would never
        shoot it! we said. Absolutely not. Then we shot it. It was good. It was
        like something inordinately beautiful and out of this world. Like I’d
        found an actual planet that I didn’t know had been there all along.
        Planet Heroin. The place where there was no pain, where it was
        unfortunate but essentially okay that my mother was dead and my
        biological father was not in my life and my family had collapsed and I
        couldn’t manage to stay married to a man I loved. At least that’s how it
        felt while I was high. In the mornings, my pain was magnified by about a
        thousand. In the mornings there weren’t only those sad facts about my
        life. Now there was also the additional fact that I was a pile of shit.
        I’d wake in Joe’s squalid room implicated by every banal thing: the lamp
        and the table, the book that had fallen and rested now belly-down and
        open, its flimsy pages buckled on the floor. In the bathroom, I’d wash
        my face and sob into my hands for a few fast breaths, getting ready for
        the waitressing job I’d picked up at a breakfast place. I’d think: This
        is not me. This is not the way I am. Stop it. No more. But in the
        afternoons I’d return with a wad of cash to buy another bit of heroin
        and I’d think: Yes. I get to do this. I get to waste my life. I get to
        be junk. But this was not to be. Lisa called me one day and said she
        wanted to see me. I’d stayed in touch with her, hanging out for long
        afternoons at her place, telling her glimmers of what I was up to. As
        soon as I walked into her house this time, I knew something was up. “So
        tell me about heroin,” she demanded. “Heroin?” I replied lightly. What
        could I possibly say? It was inexplicable, even to me. “I’m not becoming
        a junkie, if that’s what you’re worried about,” I offered. I was leaning
        against her kitchen counter, watching her sweep the floor. “That’s what
        I’m worried about,” she said sternly. “Well, don’t,” I said. I explained
        it to her as rationally and playfully as I could. It had been only a
        couple of months. We would stop soon. Joe and I were simply messing
        around, doing something fun. “It’s summertime!” I exclaimed. “Remember
        how you suggested that I come here to escape? I’m escaping.” I laughed,
        though she didn’t laugh along. I reminded her that I’d never had trouble
        with drugs before; that I drank alcohol with moderation and reserve. I
        was an experimentalist, I told her. An artist. The kind of woman who
        said yes instead of no. She challenged my every statement, questioned my
        every rationale. She swept and swept and swept the floor as our talk
        turned into an argument. She eventually became so furious with me that
        she swatted me with the broom. I went back to Joe’s and we talked about
        how Lisa just didn’t understand. Then, two weeks later, Paul called. He
        wanted to see me. Right now. Lisa had told him about Joe and about my
        using heroin, and he’d immediately driven the seventeen hundred miles
        straight through from Minneapolis to talk to me. I met him within the
        hour at Lisa’s apartment. It was a warm, sunny day in late September.
        I’d turned twenty-six the week before. Joe hadn’t remembered. It was the
        first birthday of my life when not one person had said happy birthday to
        me. “Happy birthday,” said Paul when I walked in the door. “Thank you,”
        I said, too formally. “I meant to call, but I didn’t have your number—I
        mean, Joe’s.” I nodded. It was strange to see him. My husband. A phantom
        from my actual life. The realest person I knew. We sat at the kitchen
        table with the branches of a fig tree tapping on the window nearby, the
        broom with which Lisa had struck me propped against the wall. He said,
        “You look different. You seem so … How can I say this? You seem like you
        aren’t here.” I knew what he meant. The way he looked at me told me
        everything I’d refused to hear from Lisa. I was different. I wasn’t
        there. Heroin had made me that way. And yet the idea of giving it up
        seemed impossible.</strong
