    Kennedy Meadows is called the gateway to the High Sierra, and early the next
    morning I walked through that gate. Doug and Tom accompanied me for the
    first quarter mile, but then I stopped, telling them to go on ahead because
    I had to get something from my pack. We embraced and wished one another
    well, saying goodbye forever or for fifteen minutes, we didn’t know. I
    leaned against a boulder to lift some of Monster’s weight from my back,
    watching them go. Their leaving made me melancholy, though I also felt
    something like relief when they disappeared into the dark trees. I hadn’t
    needed to get anything from my pack; I’d only wanted to be alone. Alone had
    always felt like an actual place to me, as if it weren’t a state of being,
    but rather a room where I could retreat to be who I really was. The radical
    aloneness of the PCT had altered that sense. Alone wasn’t a room anymore,
    but the whole wide world, and now I was alone in that world, occupying it in
    a way I never had before. Living at large like this, without even a roof
    over my head, made the world feel both bigger and smaller to me. Until now,
    I hadn’t truly understood the world’s vastness —hadn’t even understood how
    vast a mile could be—until each mile was beheld at walking speed. And yet
    there was also its opposite, the strange intimacy I’d come to have with the
    trail, the way the piñon pines and monkey flowers I passed that morning, the
    shallow streams I crossed, felt familiar and known, though I’d never passed
    them or crossed them before. I walked in the cool of the morning to the
    rhythm of my new white ski pole clicking against the trail, feeling the
    lightened-but-still-ridiculouslyheavy weight of Monster shift and settle in.
    When I’d set off that morning, I thought that it would feel different to be
    on the trail, that the hiking would be easier. My pack was lighter, after
    all, not only thanks to Albert’s purge but because I no longer needed to
    carry more than a couple of bottles of water at a time, now that I’d reached
    a less arid stretch of the trail. But an hour and a half into the day I
    stopped for a break, feeling the familiar aches and pains. At the same time,
    I could ever so slightly feel my body toughening up, just as Greg had
    promised would happen. It was day 1 of week 3, officially summer—the last
    week of June—and I was not only in a different season now, but in different
    country too, ascending higher in the South Sierra Wilderness. In the forty
    miles between Kennedy Meadows and Trail Pass, I’d climb from an elevation of
    just over 6,100 feet to nearly 11,000. Even in the heat of that first
    afternoon back on the trail, I could feel an edge of cool in the air that
    would no doubt envelop me at night. There was no question I was in the
    Sierra now—Muir’s beloved Range of Light. I walked beneath great dark trees
    that put the smaller plants beneath in almost complete shadow and past wide
    grassy meadows of wildflowers; I scrambled over snowmelt streams by stepping
    from one unsteady rock to another, aided by my ski pole. At foot speed, the
    Sierra Nevada seemed just barely surmountable. I could always take another
    step. It was only when I rounded a bend and glimpsed the white peaks ahead
    that I doubted my abilities, only when I thought how far I had yet to go
    that I lost faith that I would get there. Doug’s and Tom’s tracks
    periodically appeared on the alternately muddy and dusty trail, and by
    midafternoon I came upon them as they sat near a stream, their faces
    registering surprise when I walked up. I sat next to them and pumped water
    and we chatted for a while. “You should camp with us tonight if you catch up
    with us,” said Tom before they hiked on. “I already have caught up to you,”
    I replied, and we laughed. That evening I strolled into the small clearing
    where they’d pitched their tents. After dinner, they shared the two beers
    they’d brought from Kennedy Meadows, giving me swigs as we sat in the dirt
    bundled in our clothes. As we drank, I wondered which one of them had taken
    the eleven ultrathin nonlubricated Trojan condoms I’d purchased in Portland
    a few weeks before. It seemed it had to be one of them. The next day when I
    was hiking alone I came to a wide swath of snow on a steep incline, a giant
    ice-crusted sheath that obliterated the trail. It was like the rockslide,
    only scarier, a river of ice instead of stones. If I slipped while
    attempting to cross it, I would slide down the side of the mountain and
    crash into the boulders far below, or worse, fall farther into who knew
    what. Air, it seemed, from my vantage point. If I didn’t attempt to cross
    it, I’d have to go back to Kennedy Meadows. That didn’t seem like an
    altogether bad idea. And yet here I was. Hell, I thought. Bloody hell. I
    took out my ice ax and studied my course, which really only meant standing
    there for several minutes working up the nerve. I could see that Doug and
    Tom had made it across, their tracks a series of potholes in the snow. I
    held my ice ax the way Greg had taught me and stepped into one of the
    potholes. Its existence made my life both harder and easier. I didn’t have
    to chip my own steps, but those of the men were awkwardly placed and
    slippery and sometimes so deep that my boot got trapped inside and I’d lose
    my balance and fall, my ice ax so unwieldy it felt more like a burden than
    an aid. Arrest, I kept thinking, imagining what I’d do with the ax if I
    started to slide down the slope. The snow was different from the snow in
    Minnesota. In some places it was more ice than flake, so densely packed it
    reminded me of the hard layer of ice in a freezer that needs defrosting. In
    other places it gave way, slushier than it first appeared. I didn’t look at
    the bank of boulders below until I’d reached the other side of the snow and
    was standing on the muddy trail, trembling but glad. I knew that little
    jaunt was only a sample of what lay ahead. If I didn’t opt to get off the
    trail at Trail Pass to bypass the snow, I’d soon reach Forester Pass, at
    13,160 feet the highest point on the PCT. And if I didn’t slip off the side
    of the mountain while going over that pass, I’d spend the next several weeks
    crossing nothing but snow. It would be snow far more treacherous than the
    patch I’d just crossed, but having crossed even this much made what lay
    ahead more real to me. It told me that I had no choice but to bypass. I
    wasn’t rightly prepared to be on the PCT in a regular year, let alone a year
    in which the snow depth measurements were double and triple what they’d been
    the year before. There hadn’t been a winter as snowy as the previous one
    since 1983, and there wouldn’t be another for more than a dozen years. Plus,
    there wasn’t only the snow to consider. There were also the things related
    to the snow: the dangerously high rivers and streams I’d need to ford alone,
    the temperatures that would put me at risk of hypothermia, the reality that
    I’d have to rely exclusively on my map and compass for long stretches when
    the trail was concealed by the snow— all of those made more grave by the
    fact that I was alone. I didn’t have the gear I needed; I didn’t have the
    knowledge and experience. And because I was solo, I didn’t have a margin for
    error either. By bailing out like most of the other PCT hikers had, I’d miss
    the glory of the High Sierra. But if I stayed on the trail, I’d risk my
    life. “I’m getting off at Trail Pass,” I told Doug and Tom as we ate dinner
    that night. I’d hiked all day alone—logging my second fifteen-plus-mile
    day—but caught up with them again as they made camp. “I’m going to go up to
    Sierra City and get back on the trail there.” “We decided to push on,” said
    Doug. “We talked about it and we think you should join us,” said Tom. “Join
    you?” I asked, peering out from the tunnel of my dark fleece hood. I was
    wearing all the clothes I’d brought, the temperature down near freezing.
    Patches of snow surrounded us beneath the trees in spots shaded from the
    sun. “It’s not safe for you to go alone,” Doug said. “Neither one of us
    would go alone,” said Tom. “But it’s not safe for any of us to go into the
    snow. Together or alone,” I said. “We want to try it,” said Tom. “Thank
    you,” I said. “I’m touched you’d offer, but I can’t.” “Why can’t you?” Doug
    asked. “Because the point of my trip is that I’m out here to do it alone.”
    We were silent for a while then, eating our dinners, each of us cradling a
    warm pot full of rice or beans or noodles in our gloved hands. I felt sad to
    say no. Not only because I knew it meant I was opting to bypass the High
    Sierra, but because as much as I said I wanted to do this trip alone, I was
    soothed by their company. Being near Tom and Doug at night kept me from
    having to say to myself I am not afraid whenever I heard a branch snap in
    the dark or the wind shook so fiercely it seemed something bad was bound to
    happen. But I wasn’t out here to keep myself from having to say I am not
    afraid. I’d come, I realized, to stare that fear down, to stare everything
    down, really—all that I’d done to myself and all that had been done to me. I
    couldn’t do that while tagging along with someone else. After dinner, I lay
    in my tent with Flannery O’Connor’s Complete Stories on my chest, too
    exhausted to hold the book aloft. It wasn’t only that I was cold and tired
    from the day’s hike: at this elevation, the air was thinner. And yet I
    couldn’t exactly fall asleep. In what seemed a fugue state, I thought about
    what it meant to bypass the High Sierra. It basically ruined everything. All
    the planning I’d done, the way I’d mapped out the whole summer down to each
    box and meal. Now I’d be leapfrogging over 450 miles of the trail I’d
    intended to hike. I’d reach Ashland in early August instead of the middle of
    September. “Doug?” I called into the darkness, his tent only an arm’s length
    from mine. “Yeah?” “I was thinking, if I bypass, I could hike all of Oregon
    instead.” I rolled onto my side to face in the direction of his tent, half
    wishing he would come lie next to me in mine—that anyone would. It was that
    same hungry, empty feeling I’d had back in that Mojave motel when I’d wished
    I had a companion. Not someone to love. Just someone to press my body
    against. “Do you happen to know how long the trail is in Oregon?” “About
    five hundred miles,” he answered. “That’s perfect,” I said, my heartbeat
    quickening with the idea before I closed my eyes and fell into a deep sleep.
    The next afternoon Greg caught up to me just before I reached Trail Pass
    Trail, my route off the PCT. “I’m bypassing,” I said to him reluctantly. “I
    am too,” he said. “You are?” I asked with relief and delight. “It’s way too
    socked-in up here,” he said, and we looked around at the wind-twisted
    foxtail pines among the trailside boulders; the mountains and ridges visible
    miles away under the pure blue sky. The highest point of the trail was only
    thirty-five trail miles farther on. The summit of Mount Whitney, the highest
    peak in the contiguous United States, was closer still, a short detour off
    the PCT. Together we descended Trail Pass Trail two miles down to a picnic
    area and campground at Horseshoe Meadows, where we met up with Doug and Tom
    and hitched a ride into Lone Pine. I hadn’t planned to go there. Some PCT
    hikers had resupply boxes sent to Lone Pine, but I’d planned to push through
    to the town of Independence, another fifty trail miles to the north. I still
    had a few days’ worth of food in my bag, but when we reached town I went
    immediately to a grocery store to replenish my stock. I needed enough to
    last for the ninety-six-mile section I’d be hiking once I made the bypass,
    from Sierra City to Belden Town. Afterwards, I found a pay phone and called
    Lisa and left a message on her answering machine, explaining my new plan as
    quickly as I could, asking her to send my box addressed to Belden Town
    immediately and hold all the others until I gave her the details of my new
    itinerary. I felt dislocated and melancholy when I hung up the phone, less
    excited about being in town than I thought I’d be. I walked along the main
    street until I found the men. “We’re heading back up,” said Doug, his eyes
    meeting mine. My chest felt tight as I hugged him and Tom goodbye. I’d come
    to feel a sort of love for them, but on top of that, I was worried. “Are you
    sure you want to go up into the snow?” I asked. “Are you sure you don’t?”
    Tom replied. “You still have your good luck charm,” said Doug, pointing to
    the black feather he’d given me back in Kennedy Meadows. I’d wedged it into
    Monster’s frame, up over my right shoulder. “Something to remember you by,”
    I said, and we laughed. After they left, I walked with Greg to the
    convenience store that doubled as the town’s Greyhound bus station. We
    passed bars that billed themselves as Old West saloons and shops that had
    cowboy hats and framed paintings of men astride bucking broncos displayed in
    their front windows. “You ever see High Sierra with Humphrey Bogart?” Greg
    asked. I shook my head. “That was made here. Plus lots of other movies.
    Westerns.” I nodded, unsurprised. The landscape did in fact look straight
    out of Hollywood—a high sage-covered flat that was more barren than not,
    rocky and treeless with a view that went on for miles. The white peaks of
    the Sierra Nevada to the west cut so dramatically up into the blue sky that
    they seemed almost unreal to me, a gorgeous façade.

    “There’s our ride,” Greg said, pointing to a big Greyhound bus in a parking
    lot of the store as we approached. But he was wrong. There were no buses
    that went all the way to Sierra City, we learned. We’d have to catch a bus
    that evening and ride seven hours to Reno, Nevada, then take another one for
    an hour to Truckee, California. From there we’d have no option but to
    hitchhike the final forty-five miles to Sierra City. We bought two one-way
    tickets and an armful of snacks and sat on the warm pavement at the edge of
    the convenience store parking lot waiting for the bus to come. We polished
    off whole bags of chips and cans of soda while talking. We ran through the
    Pacific Crest Trail as a conversational topic, through backpacking gear and
    the record snowpack one more time, through the “ultralight” theories and
    practices of Ray Jardine and of his followers—who may or may not have
    misinterpreted the spirit behind those theories and practices—and finally
    arrived at ourselves. I asked him about his job and life in Tacoma. He had
    no pets and no kids and a girlfriend he’d been dating a year. She was an
    avid backpacker too. His life, it was clear, was an ordered and considered
    thing. It seemed both boring and astounding to me. I didn’t know what mine
    seemed like to him. The bus to Reno was nearly empty when we got on at last.
    I followed Greg to the middle, where we took pairs of seats directly
    opposite each other across the aisle. “I’m going to get some sleep,” he said
    once the bus lurched onto the highway. “Me too,” I said, though I knew it
    wasn’t true. Even when I was exhausted, I could never sleep in moving
    vehicles of any sort, and I wasn’t exhausted. I was lit up by being back in
    the world. I stared out the window while Greg slept. Nobody who’d known me
    for more than a week had any idea where I was. I am en route to Reno,
    Nevada, I thought with a kind of wonder. I’d never been to Reno. It seemed
    the most preposterous place for me to be going, dressed as I was and dirty
    as a dog, my hair dense as a burlap bag. I pulled all the money from my
    pockets and counted the bills and coins, using my headlamp to see. I had
    forty-four dollars and seventy-five cents. My heart sank at the paltry sight
    of it. I’d spent far more money than I’d imagined I would have by now. I
    hadn’t anticipated stops in Ridgecrest and Lone Pine, nor the bus ticket to
    Truckee. I wasn’t going to get more money until I reached my next resupply
    box in Belden Town more than a week from now, and even then it would be only
    twenty bucks. Greg and I had agreed we’d get rooms in a motel in Sierra City
    to rest up for a night after our long travels, but I had the sickening
    feeling I’d have to find a place to camp instead. There was nothing I could
    do about it. I didn’t have a credit card. I’d simply have to get through on
    what I had. I cursed myself for not having put more money in my boxes at the
    same time that I acknowledged I couldn’t have. I’d put into my boxes all the
    money I’d had. I’d saved up my tips all winter and spring and sold a good
    portion of my possessions, and with that money I’d purchased all the food in
    my boxes and all the gear that had been on that bed in the Mojave motel, and
    I wrote a check to Lisa to cover postage for the boxes and another check to
    cover four months of payments on the student loans for the degree I didn’t
    have that I’d be paying for until I was forty-three. The amount I had left
    over was the amount I could spend on the PCT. I put my money back in my
    pocket, turned my headlamp off, and stared out my window to the west,
    feeling a sad unease. I was homesick, but I didn’t know if it was for the
    life I used to have or for the PCT. I could just barely make out the dark
    silhouette of the Sierra Nevada against the moonlit sky. It looked like that
    impenetrable wall again, the way it had to me a few years before when I’d
    first seen it while driving with Paul, but it didn’t feel impenetrable
    anymore. I could imagine myself on it, in it, part of it. I knew the way it
    felt to navigate it one step at a time. I would be back on it again as soon
    as I hiked away from Sierra City. I was bypassing the High Sierra—missing
    Sequoia and Kings Canyon and Yosemite national parks, Tuolumne Meadows and
    the John Muir and Desolation wildernesses and so much more—but I’d still be
    hiking another hundred miles in the Sierra Nevada beyond that, before
    heading into the Cascade Range. By the time the bus pulled into the station
    in Reno at 4 a.m., I hadn’t slept a minute. Greg and I had an hour to kill
    before the next bus would depart for Truckee, so we wandered blearily
    through the small casino that adjoined the bus station, our packs strapped
    to our backs. I was tired but wired, sipping hot Lipton tea from a Styrofoam
    cup. Greg played blackjack and won three dollars. I fished three quarters
    out of my pocket, played all three in a slot machine, and lost everything.
