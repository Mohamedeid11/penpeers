    THE TEN THOUSAND THINGS My solo three-month hike on the Pacific Crest Trail
    had many beginnings. There was the first, flip decision to do it, followed
    by the second, more serious decision to actually do it, and then the long
    third beginning, composed of weeks of shopping and packing and preparing to
    do it. There was the quitting my job as a waitress and finalizing my divorce
    and selling almost everything I owned and saying goodbye to my friends and
    visiting my mother’s grave one last time. There was the driving across the
    country from Minneapolis to Portland, Oregon, and, a few days later,
    catching a flight to Los Angeles and a ride to the town of Mojave and
    another ride to the place where the PCT crossed a highway. At which point,
    at long last, there was the actual doing it, quickly followed by the grim
    realization of what it meant to do it, followed by the decision to quit
    doing it because doing it was absurd and pointless and ridiculously
    difficult and far more than I expected doing it would be and I was
    profoundly unprepared to do it. And then there was the real live truly doing
    it. The staying and doing it, in spite of everything. In spite of the bears
    and the rattlesnakes and the scat of the mountain lions I never saw; the
    blisters and scabs and scrapes and lacerations. The exhaustion and the
    deprivation; the cold and the heat; the monotony and the pain; the thirst
    and the hunger; the glory and the ghosts that haunted me as I hiked eleven
    hundred miles from the Mojave Desert to the state of Washington by myself.
    And finally, once I’d actually gone and done it, walked all those miles for
    all those days, there was the realization that what I’d thought was the
    beginning had not really been the beginning at all. That in truth my hike on
    the Pacific Crest Trail hadn’t begun when I made the snap decision to do it.
    It had begun before I even imagined it, precisely four years, seven months,
    and three days before, when I’d stood in a little room at the Mayo Clinic in
    Rochester, Minnesota, and learned that my mother was going to die. I was
    wearing green. Green pants, green shirt, green bow in my hair. It was an
    outfit that my mother had sewn—she’d made clothes for me all of my life.
    Some of them were just what I dreamed of having, others less so. I wasn’t
    crazy about the green pantsuit, but I wore it anyway, as a penance, as an
    offering, as a talisman. All that day of the green pantsuit, as I
    accompanied my mother and stepfather, Eddie, from floor to floor of the Mayo
    Clinic while my mother went from one test to another, a prayer marched
    through my head, though prayer is not the right word to describe that march.
    I wasn’t humble before God. I didn’t even believe in God. My prayer was not:
    Please, God, take mercy on us. I was not going to ask for mercy. I didn’t
    need to. My mother was forty-five. She looked fine. For a good number of
    years she’d mostly been a vegetarian. She’d planted marigolds around her
    garden to keep bugs away instead of using pesticides. My siblings and I had
    been made to swallow raw cloves of garlic when we had colds. People like my
    mother did not get cancer. The tests at the Mayo Clinic would prove that,
    refuting what the doctors in Duluth had said. I was certain of this. Who
    were those doctors in Duluth anyway? What was Duluth? Duluth! Duluth was a
    freezing hick town where doctors who didn’t know what the hell they were
    talking about told forty-five-year-old vegetarian-ish, garlic-eating,
    natural-remedy-using nonsmokers that they had late-stage lung cancer, that’s
    what. Fuck them. That was my prayer: Fuckthemfuckthemfuckthem. And yet, here
    was my mother at the Mayo Clinic getting worn out if she had to be on her
    feet for more than three minutes. “You want a wheelchair?” Eddie asked her
    when we came upon a row of them in a long carpeted hall. “She doesn’t need a
    wheelchair,” I said. “Just for a minute,” said my mother, almost collapsing
    into one, her eyes meeting mine before Eddie wheeled her toward the
    elevator. I followed behind, not allowing myself to think a thing. We were
    finally on our way up to see the last doctor. The real doctor, we kept
    calling him. The one who would gather everything that had been gathered
    about my mom and tell us what was true. As the elevator car lifted, my
    mother reached out to tug at my pants, rubbing the green cotton between her
    fingers proprietarily. “Perfect,” she said. I was twenty-two, the same age
    she was when she’d been pregnant with me. She was going to leave my life at
    the same moment that I came into hers, I thought. For some reason that
    sentence came fully formed into my head just then, temporarily blotting out
    the Fuck them prayer. I almost howled in agony. I almost choked to death on
    what I knew before I knew. I was going to live the rest of my life without
    my mother. I pushed the fact of it away with everything in me. I couldn’t
    let myself believe it then and there in that elevator and also go on
    breathing, so I let myself believe other things instead. Such as if a doctor
    told you that you were going to die soon, you’d be taken to a room with a
    gleaming wooden desk.

    This was not so. We were led into an examining room, where a nurse
    instructed my mother to remove her shirt and put on a cotton smock with
    strings that dangled at her sides. When my mother had done so, she climbed
    onto a padded table with white paper stretched over it. Each time she moved,
    the room was on fire with the paper ripping and crinkling beneath her. I
    could see her naked back, the small curve of flesh beneath her waist. She
    was not going to die. Her naked back seemed proof of that. I was staring at
    it when the real doctor came into the room and said my mother would be lucky
    if she lived a year. He explained that they would not attempt to cure her,
    that she was incurable. There was nothing that could have been done, he told
    us. Finding it so late was common, when it came to lung cancer. “But she’s
    not a smoker,” I countered, as if I could talk him out of the diagnosis, as
    if cancer moved along reasonable, negotiable lines. “She only smoked when
    she was younger. She hasn’t had a cigarette for years.” The doctor shook his
    head sadly and pressed on. He had a job to do. They could try to ease the
    pain in her back with radiation, he offered. Radiation might reduce the size
    of the tumors that were growing along the entire length of her spine. I did
    not cry. I only breathed. Horribly. Intentionally. And then forgot to
    breathe. I’d fainted once—furious, age three, holding my breath because I
    didn’t want to get out of the bathtub, too young to remember it myself. What
    did you do? What did you do? I’d asked my mother all through my childhood,
    making her tell me the story again and again, amazed and delighted by my own
    impetuous will. She’d held out her hands and watched me turn blue, my mother
    had always told me. She’d waited me out until my head fell into her palms
    and I took a breath and came back to life. Breathe. “Can I ride my horse?”
    my mother asked the real doctor. She sat with her hands folded tightly
    together and her ankles hooked one to the other. Shackled to herself. In
    reply, he took a pencil, stood it upright on the edge of the sink, and
    tapped it hard on the surface. “This is your spine after radiation,” he
    said. “One jolt and your bones could crumble like a dry cracker.” We went to
    the women’s restroom. Each of us locked in separate stalls, weeping. We
    didn’t exchange a word. Not because we felt so alone in our grief, but
    because we were so together in it, as if we were one body instead of two. I
    could feel my mother’s weight leaning against the door, her hands slapping
    slowly against it, causing the entire frame of the bathroom stalls to shake.
    Later we came out to wash our hands and faces, watching each other in the
    bright mirror. We were sent to the pharmacy to wait. I sat between my mother
    and Eddie in my green pantsuit, the green bow miraculously still in my hair.
    There was a big bald boy in an old man’s lap. There was a woman who had an
    arm that swung wildly from the elbow. She held it stiffly with the other
    hand, trying to calm it. She waited. We waited. There was a beautiful
    dark-haired woman who sat in a wheelchair. She wore a purple hat and a
    handful of diamond rings. We could not take our eyes off her. She spoke in
    Spanish to the people gathered around her, her family and perhaps her
    husband. “Do you think she has cancer?” my mother whispered loudly to me.
    Eddie sat on my other side, but I could not look at him. If I looked him we
    would both crumble like dry crackers. I thought about my older sister,
    Karen, and my younger brother, Leif. About my husband, Paul, and about my
    mother’s parents and sister, who lived a thousand miles away. What they
    would say when they knew. How they would cry. My prayer was different now: A
    year, a year, a year. Those two words beat like a heart in my chest. That’s
    how long my mother would live. “What are you thinking about?” I asked her.
    There was a song coming over the waiting room speakers. A song without
    words, but my mother knew the words anyway and instead of answering my
    question she sang them softly to me. “Paper roses, paper roses, oh how real
    those roses seemed to be,” she sang. She put her hand on mine and said, “I
    used to listen to that song when I was young. It’s funny to think of that.
    To think about listening to the same song now. I would’ve never known.” My
    mother’s name was called then: her prescriptions were ready. “Go get them
    for me,” she said. “Tell them who you are. Tell them you’re my daughter.” I
    was her daughter, but more. I was Karen, Cheryl, Leif. Karen Cheryl Leif.
    Karen Cheryl Leif. Our names blurred into one in my mother’s mouth all my
    life. She whispered it and hollered it, hissed it and crooned it. We were
    her kids, her comrades, the end of her and the beginning. We took turns
    riding shotgun with her in the car. “Do I love you this much?” she’d ask us,
    holding her hands six inches apart. “No,” we’d say, with sly smiles. “Do I
    love you this much?” she’d ask again, and on and on and on, each time moving
    her hands farther apart. But she would never get there, no matter how wide
    she stretched her arms. The amount that she loved us was beyond her reach.
    It could not be quantified or contained. It was the ten thousand named
    things in the Tao Te Ching’s universe and then ten thousand more. Her love
    was full-throated and all-encompassing and unadorned. Every day she blew
    through her entire reserve.
