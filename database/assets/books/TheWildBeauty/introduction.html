    The trees were tall, but I was taller, standing above them on a steep
    mountain slope in northern California. Moments before, I’d removed my hiking
    boots and the left one had fallen into those trees, first catapulting into
    the air when my enormous backpack toppled onto it, then skittering across
    the gravelly trail and flying over the edge. It bounced off of a rocky
    outcropping several feet beneath me before disappearing into the forest
    canopy below, impossible to retrieve. I let out a stunned gasp, though I’d
    been in the wilderness thirty-eight days and by then I’d come to know that
    anything could happen and that everything would. But that doesn’t mean I
    wasn’t shocked when it did. My boot was gone. Actually gone. I clutched its
    mate to my chest like a baby, though of course it was futile. What is one
    boot without the other boot? It is nothing. It is useless, an orphan
    forevermore, and I could take no mercy on it. It was a big lug of a thing,
    of genuine heft, a brown leather Raichle boot with a red lace and silver
    metal fasts. I lifted it high and threw it with all my might and watched it
    fall into the lush trees and out of my life. I was alone. I was barefoot. I
    was twenty-six years old and an orphan too. An actual stray, a stranger had
    observed a couple of weeks before, when I’d told him my name and explained
    how very loose I was in the world. My father left my life when I was six. My
    mother died when I was twenty-two. In the wake of her death, my stepfather
    morphed from the person I considered my dad into a man I only occasionally
    recognized. My two siblings scattered in their grief, in spite of my efforts
    to hold us together, until I gave up and scattered as well. In the years
    before I pitched my boot over the edge of that mountain, I’d been pitching
    myself over the edge too. I’d ranged and roamed and railed—from Minnesota to
    New York to Oregon and all across the West —until at last I found myself,
    bootless, in the summer of 1995, not so much loose in the world as bound to
    it. It was a world I’d never been to and yet had known was there all along,
    one I’d staggered to in sorrow and confusion and fear and hope. A world I
    thought would both make me into the woman I knew I could become and turn me
    back into the girl I’d once been. A world that measured two feet wide and
    2,663 miles long. A world called the Pacific Crest Trail. I’d first heard of
    it only seven months before, when I was living in Minneapolis, sad and
    desperate and on the brink of divorcing a man I still loved. I’d been
    standing in line at an outdoor store waiting to purchase a foldable shovel
    when I picked up a book called The Pacific Crest Trail, Volume 1: California
    from a nearby shelf and read the back cover. The PCT, it said, was a
    continuous wilderness trail that went from the Mexican border in California
    to just beyond the Canadian border along the crest of nine mountain
    ranges—the Laguna, San Jacinto, San Bernardino, San Gabriel, Liebre,
    Tehachapi, Sierra Nevada, Klamath, and Cascades. That distance was a
    thousand miles as the crow flies, but the trail was more than double that.
    Traversing the entire length of the states of California, Oregon, and
    Washington, the PCT passes through national parks and wilderness areas as
    well as federal, tribal, and privately held lands; through deserts and
    mountains and rain forests; across rivers and highways. I turned the book
    over and gazed at its front cover—a boulder-strewn lake surrounded by rocky
    crags against a blue sky—then placed it back on the shelf, paid for my
    shovel, and left. But later I returned and bought the book. The Pacific
    Crest Trail wasn’t a world to me then. It was an idea, vague and outlandish,
    full of promise and mystery. Something bloomed inside me as I traced its
    jagged line with my finger on a map. I would walk that line, I decided—or at
    least as much of it as I could in about a hundred days. I was living alone
    in a studio apartment in Minneapolis, separated from my husband, and working
    as a waitress, as low and mixed-up as I’d ever been in my life. Each day I
    felt as if I were looking up from the bottom of a deep well. But from that
    well, I set about becoming a solo wilderness trekker. And why not? I’d been
    so many things already. A loving wife and an adulteress. A beloved daughter
    who now spent holidays alone. An ambitious overachiever and aspiring writer
    who hopped from one meaningless job to the next while dabbling dangerously
    with drugs and sleeping with too many men. I was the granddaughter of a
    Pennsylvania coal miner, the daughter of a steelworker turned salesman.
    After my parents split up, I lived with my mother, brother, and sister in
    apartment complexes populated by single mothers and their kids. As a teen, I
    lived back-to-the-land style in the Minnesota northwoods in a house that
    didn’t have an indoor toilet, electricity, or running water. In spite of
    this, I’d become a high school cheerleader and homecoming queen, and then I
    went off to college and became a left-wing feminist campus radical. But a
    woman who walks alone in the wilderness for eleven hundred miles? I’d never
    been anything like that before. I had nothing to lose by giving it a whirl.
    It seemed like years ago now—as I stood barefoot on that mountain in
    California—in a different lifetime, really, when I’d made the arguably
    unreasonable decision to take a long walk alone on the PCT in order to save
    myself. When I believed that all the things I’d been before had prepared me
    for this journey. But nothing had or could. Each day on the trail was the
    only possible preparation for the one that followed. And sometimes even the
    day before didn’t prepare me for what would happen next.

    Such as my boots sailing irretrievably off the side of a mountain. The truth
    is, I was only half sorry to see them go. In the six weeks I’d spent in
    those boots, I’d trekked across deserts and snow, past trees and bushes and
    grasses and flowers of all shapes and sizes and colors, walked up and down
    mountains and over fields and glades and stretches of land I couldn’t
    possibly define, except to say that I had been there, passed over it, made
    it through. And all the while, those boots had blistered my feet and rubbed
    them raw; they’d caused my nails to blacken and detach themselves
    excruciatingly from four of my toes. I was done with those boots by the time
    I lost them and those boots were done with me, though it’s also true that I
    loved them. They had become not so much inanimate objects to me as
    extensions of who I was, as had just about everything else I carried that
    summer—my backpack, tent, sleeping bag, water purifier, ultralight stove,
    and the little orange whistle that I carried in lieu of a gun. They were the
    things I knew and could rely upon, the things that got me through. I looked
    down at the trees below me, the tall tops of them waving gently in the hot
    breeze. They could keep my boots, I thought, gazing across the great green
    expanse. I’d chosen to rest in this place because of the view. It was late
    afternoon in mid-July, and I was miles from civilization in every direction,
    days away from the lonely post office where I’d collect my next resupply
    box. There was a chance someone would come hiking down the trail, but only
    rarely did that happen. Usually I went days without seeing another person.
    It didn’t matter whether someone came along anyway. I was in this alone. I
    gazed at my bare and battered feet, with their smattering of remaining
    toenails. They were ghostly pale to the line a few inches above my ankles,
    where the wool socks I usually wore ended. My calves above them were muscled
    and golden and hairy, dusted with dirt and a constellation of bruises and
    scratches. I’d started walking in the Mojave Desert and I didn’t plan to
    stop until I touched my hand to a bridge that crosses the Columbia River at
    the Oregon-Washington border with the grandiose name the Bridge of the Gods.
    I looked north, in its direction—the very thought of that bridge a beacon to
    me. I looked south, to where I’d been, to the wild land that had schooled
    and scorched me, and considered my options. There was only one, I knew.
    There was always only one. To keep walking.
