    ou want to know the first secret to drawing? Find the best tools available!
    You have to have the right toys. Having<br />the proper pencils, paper,
    erasers and other tools can make a big difference in your art. I’ll show you
    what I prefer,<br />but I fully expect you to develop an addiction to trying
    out new drawing supplies on your own. Think of it as the<br />chocolate in
    your art life.<br />In addition to the right supplies, you need something to
    draw from. Whether it’s a photograph, still life setup, live model or<br />a
    trip to the great outdoors for some plein air sketching (and maybe a little
    bug-slapping), the inspiration for your artwork can<br />come in many
    different forms.

    <strong>Pencils</strong><br />Your cheerful yellow No. 2 pencil usually
    contains an HB lead. It would perform just fine as a drawing pencil, but
    ask<br />yourself, is it really cool? No, buying a sparkly version doesn’t
    make it better. You need stuff, remember? There are quite a<br />few pencil
    choices to consider:<br />• Mechanical pencils come in a variety of colors
    and are easily found in most art stores. They usually consist of a
    plastic<br />holder and a fine HB lead that advances by clicking on an end
    or side button. They create consistent lines of equal width.<br />• Lead
    holders are available in the drafting section of most office supply stores
    and come with an HB lead. Various grades<br />of 2mm lead can be purchased
    and easily placed into the holder. The main difference between lead holders
    and<br />mechanical pencils is that a mechanical pencil cannot be sharpened.
    Unlike a lead holder, its tip is very small and will<br />break if you apply
    too much pressure.<br />• Graphite and charcoal pencils differ in several
    ways. Graphite pencils, often called lead pencils, consist of ground<br />graphite
    mixed with clay and placed in a wooden holder. They are available in many
    grades, although there is a slight<br />difference in the darkness among
    brands. They often create a shine in the drawing as light hits the surface.
    Charcoal<br />pencils have more “drag” when you use them, may be more
    difficult to erase, and create a different appearance in your<br />drawing.
    They often come in only three or four degrees of darkness.<br />• Carbon
    pencils combine the darkness of charcoal with the smoothness of graphite and
    may be combined with either<br />graphite or charcoal in a single
    drawing.<br />• Ebony pencils are very dark, smooth graphite pencils. Many
    artists love these pencils, but they may limit your ability to<br />build
    subtle tones.<br />• Wash pencils are water-soluble graphite pencils. They
    may be applied to wet or dry watercolor paper. You can also apply<br />a
    wash of clean water for different effects.<br />Pencil Grades<br />There are
    about twenty grades of graphite available, ranging from the lightest and
    hardest at one end of the scale (9H), to<br />the softest and darkest at the
    other end (9B). The HB lead in your yellow pencil is medium-grade, workable
    lead (or,<br />technically, graphite). Your choice of pencil is determined
    by your drawing style and paper choice.

    <br /><strong>1. Expose the Correct Amount of Lead</strong><br />The top of
    the lead pointer has two small holes. Release some of the lead from the
    holder and place it into one of the holes.

    exact amount of lead you will need to sharpen. Slide the extra lead back
    into your pencil until the metal tip rests on the sharpener.

    <br /><strong>4. Sharpen</strong><br />Place the lead holder into the larger
    opening. Jiggle it so it’s correctly positioned. The entire top will rotate
    in a circle,<br />sharpening all sides. Don’t worry if you don’t do well the
    first time. This takes a bit of practice.

    <strong>Erasers</strong><br />Most people have the idea that erasers are
    used only for boo-boos. Make a mark, erase it. Make another mark, erase
    again.<br />Erasers are far more useful than that. They can lighten areas,
    create textures and add a variety of different effects to your<br />drawing.<br />Unlike
    pencils, erasers are not lined up and clearly labeled for the shopper’s
    convenience, so you’ll need to investigate<br />your options before making a
    purchase. There is a wide selection of erasers available, each varying in
    hardness (or firmness)<br />and messiness (how much eraser residue is left
    behind). The upside, though, is that with so many options you’re
    guaranteed<br />to find an eraser that suits your needs.<br /><strong
        >Types of Erasers</strong
    ><br /><strong>• Pink Pearl</strong> is a common eraser with attitude. It
    gets into your drawing and really tears up the graphite. But be cautious:<br />The
    same aggression this eraser applies to graphite is also applied to your
    paper. There’s a possibility that your paper will<br />be roughened up as
    well.<br /><strong>• Kneaded erasers</strong> made from rubber are soft and
    pliable. You can wad them into a point to lift graphite out of tight
    places<br />or use them to lighten an area that’s too dark by pushing them
    straight down on the art, then lifting. Clean them by<br />stretching them
    back on themselves.<br /><strong>• White plastic</strong> or vinyl erasers
    are your best choice for general cleanup. They are nonabrasive, tend to be
    gentle on your<br />work and leave behind no residue.<br /><strong
        >• Gum erasers</strong
    >
    are useful but terribly messy. They shed worse than a collie in spring.<br /><strong
        >• Electric erasers </strong
    >are great, especially the smaller, battery-operated versions.<br />I use
    the white plastic and kneaded erasers the most. I like the way the white
    plastic eraser handles the paper—gently yet<br />efficiently. The kneaded
    eraser lifts out the graphite without destroying the underlying pencil
    lines.
</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>• Going Electric</strong><br />Drawing supplies are
    inexpensive compared to other mediums. Think about the money you’ll save!
    Because you have all<br />that extra money, you’re now going to spend it on
    your first big purchase: a portable electric eraser.<br />There are several
    brands of portable electric erasers on the market, but I find the Sakura
    brand works best. Some brands<br />spin too fast, grinding into the paper
    and leaving rough spots. Some brands stop spinning as soon as you touch the
    paper. The<br />Sakura eraser has the right spin to erase, can be sharpened
    to a fine point by using a sanding block and is easy to hold.

    <br /><strong>My Favorite Kneaded Erasers</strong><br />Colored kneaded
    erasers by Faber–Castell don’t stain your work and come in red, yellow and
    blue. Blue’s my favorite; it matches my eyes.

    <br /><strong>Creating White Lines</strong><br />You can’t draw white lines
    on white paper, but you can lift them out of your shading using the electric
    eraser. Practice creating the effect of white hairs,<br />eyebrows or
    highlights in the eyes and hair.

    <strong>Sharpening Your Electric Eraser Tip</strong><br />In order to “draw
    with white,” that is, make fine lines with your eraser, you’ll need to
    sharpen the tip. An old piece of sandpaper works fine, as does a sanding<br />block
    created for artists. T urn on your eraser and angle it so that the spinning
    eraser forms a sharp point.

    <br /><strong>Drawing White Lines</strong><br />An electric eraser with a
    sharpened tip allows you to accurately draw white lines through your shaded

        ><strong>Other Absolutely Necessary Toys</strong></span
    ><br />I once handed my five-year-old nephew a toy catalog and asked him
    what he wanted for Christmas. He opened the book<br />and studied the first
    page intently, then said, “everything on this page.” He looked at the facing
    page, waved his hand over it<br />and declared, “everything on this page,
    too.” He went through the entire book like that, asking for everything but
    the dolls.<br />No, you don’t need to buy everything on every page of the
    art supply catalog, but you do need to add a few more items to<br />your
    shopping cart.
</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>Ruler</strong><br />We’ll use a ruler for a variety of
    different projects, and the best one by far is the C-Thru plastic ruler. The
    C-Thru ruler has<br />a centering section so you can find the middle of
    anything. The interior lines make it easy to create 90-degree angles
    (trust<br />me, you’ll need that). I prefer the 12" × 2" (30cm × 5cm)
    version.
</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>Circle Template</strong><br />Certain things are a given.
    Chocolates have calories. You’ll run into the most people you know at the
    grocery store when you<br />look your worst. And drawing perfectly round
    circles is impossible without help. The next item for your drawing kit is a
    circle<br />template. You can find it in most drafting areas of office
    supply stores as well as general art stores. You will absolutely need<br />it.
    Find one with a variety of small holes.
</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>Erasing Shields</strong><br />Erasing shields are inexpensive
    tools made of thin metal that you erase over top of to create different
    effects. You can<br />create a custom template by cutting through a piece of
    acetate with a hobby knife. The best acetate to use is clear plastic<br />report
    covers.
</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>Blending Tools</strong><br />Many artists use their pencils to
    create shading, smudging and blending without resorting to some form of a
    blending device.<br />It can make for a beautiful drawing, but requires
    skillful handling of the pencil. You may also take the other route and
    create<br />nice shading with tools.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A short
    list of blending tools includes a paper stump, tortillon, chamois and a
    cosmetic sponge. Don’t even think of using<br />your finger because the oils
    will transfer to your paper. The paper stump is used on its side; the
    tortillon is used on its tip.<br /><br /><strong>Horsehair Brush</strong
    ><br />My final toy is a horsehair brush to remove the erasing dandruff. A
    bird feather, soft-complexion brush or soft paint brush<br />also work well.
    You don’t want to use your hand because that will smear the drawing, and if
    you try to blow the debris off,<br />there’s a good chance that you might
    include some spit. Take it from me, spit doesn’t add to your drawing.
