    hances are you’ve already tried to draw your favorite subject on your own.
    If you didn’t get the results you were<br />hoping for—and you most likely
    didn’t if you bought this book!—your inaccurate (or incomplete) perception
    of your<br />subject may not be the only culprit. Your technique of putting
    pencil to paper may take some of the blame. Maybe<br />your rendering was
    close, but not quite right. That’s OK! The first step is to actually get off
    your duff and give it a try. From<br />there it’s all about practice.<br />Before
    ballet dancers start dancing, they practice their positions. Singers go
    through pre-concert vocal warm-ups. A writer<br />might start the day with
    some journaling or maybe a cup of coffee. As an artist, you’re in the same
    boat—you need to warm<br />up before you cut loose. Consider this chapter
    your pre-drawing warm-up. It’s designed to get you drawing and using your<br />tools
    correctly. All the tools, techniques, secrets and ideas won’t help you
    without some practice, so grab your box of<br />drawing goodies and let’s
    get going.

    <span class="text-big"><strong>The ABCs of Drawing</strong></span
    ><br />You first learned the alphabet as a series of shapes. You committed
    to memory the shapes of twenty-six letters (actually,<br />fifty-two when
    you count both lowercase and uppercase). You memorized the letters and the
    sounds they made. You might<br />have even learned by placing the alphabet
    into a song: “A-B-C-D …” and so on (although the letter “ellameno” took
    some<br />time to figure out!). Then you combined the letters to form simple
    words like cat, dog, run and see.<br />In drawing, there are really only two
    kinds of shapes to learn: straight and curved. These simple shapes can be
    combined<br />to form simple, recognizable images. All of us are able to
    combine straight and curved lines to create the simplest of<br />drawings.<br />In
    reading, you eventually progressed to more and bigger words. With each
    passing day, you acquired more and more<br />words for your memorized
    dictionary. Then you strung the words together to form sentences. In art,
    you might have taken a<br />turn at drawing a more complex critter or
    car.<br />Here’s where the natural artists and the rest of the world part.
    The natural artists develop a few skills to move on and<br />draw more
    accurately. Everybody else figures there’s no hope and throws down their
    pencils in disgust.<br />So what’s the problem then? Why can’t your drawings
    progress past this most basic stage? Understanding how your mind<br />works
    can help you overcome this roadblock.

    <br /><strong>Mastering the Shapes</strong><br />Learning how to read
    demanded that you memorize the shapes that made up each letter. Learning the
    letter R, for example, required you to learn the series of<br />curved and
    straight shapes that combined to form the letter.

    <span class="text-big"><strong>Thinking in Patterns</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
    <br />The human brain is very efficient. It processes information at an
    astounding rate, then places that information into a<br />memorized pattern
    so it makes sense to us in the future. For instance, we learn to recognize
    letters of the alphabet by<br />memorizing their shapes. Once memorized,
    these shapes are stored in the brain and recalled when necessary. It is this
    ability<br />to recall information that prevents you from having to relearn
    the alphabet every time you sit down to read.<br />The same process applies
    to objects around us. Your brain records a recognizable pattern for each
    object and recalls that<br />pattern when necessary. So why doesn’t the
    object in your drawing look like it does in real life? The answer is simple:
    When<br />you draw, it is the memorized pattern that you usually reproduce
    on paper, not the reality of the object in front of you.<br />Anything
    unique about the object you see may be lost when your brain recalls the
    pattern on file.<br />Along with stubbornly adhering to memorized patterns,
    your brain records only essential visual information, not every<br />single
    detail. To prove this point, try drawing a one dollar bill without looking
    at it, and then compare it to the real thing.<br />Notice any differences?
    Even though you’ve seen the dollar bill countless times, your brain hasn’t
    recorded the exact details.<br />In fact, you’ve likely only stored enough
    information to distinguish this piece of currency from any other piece of
    paper.<br />This means our mental patterns of most objects we want to draw
    are missing the details necessary to make the object<br />appear realistic.
    You may be wondering, then, how veteran artists are able to crank out
    realistic drawings without even<br />breaking a sweat. This is because our
    brains continually add shapes and images to our dictionary of patterns. For
    example,<br />you have learned to read a sentence regardless of the font or
    handwriting style used. The same happens with drawing:<br />Artists who have
    been drawing for some time have a large dictionary of patterns that they
    have been adding to over time.<br />They have probably sketched them many
    times as well.<br />So how do you build your dictionary of patterns and
    ultimately improve your drawings? It’s all about understanding<br />perception,
    which we’ll talk about next.

    <br /><strong>The Problem of Primitive Patterns</strong><br />When we write,
    we rely on our memorized shapes to communicate. T hat’s fine for writing but
    lousy for drawing. Memorized patterns seldom help us create<br />realistic
    drawings when we’re starting out. T his is the case with each of the objects
    pictured here. Sure you can recognize the objects, but they are a far cry<br />from
    realistic representations. You must expand your mental dictionary of
    patterns if you want your drawings to improve.

    <span class="text-big"><strong>Perception</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
    <br />Seeing as an artist is not about vision, the function of the eyes.
    It’s about perception, the mind’s ability to interpret what we<br />see. A
    good definition of perception is the process by which people gather,
    process, organize and understand the world<br />through their five senses.
    With this in mind, there are two important points that every artist should
    know about perception.<br />First, each of us has a filter that affects our
    perceptions. By shaping your filter to meet your interests, you can build
    upon<br />your dictionary of patterns and develop your artistic skills.
    However, it can be a challenge to alter your perception without<br />study
    and practice.<br />This brings us to the second point: Perceptions are
    powerful—so powerful that they don’t change unless a significant<br />event
    occurs. In drawing, this significant event is training. The goal is to give
    you tools to bypass that filter and train your<br />mind.
</p>
<p>
    <br /><strong>Filters</strong><br />Perception filters exist solely to keep
    us from overloading on too much information. If we didn’t have filters in
    place, we<br />would suffer from sensory surplus. As handy as your filters
    may be in everyday life, they must be shaped and altered for you<br />to
    become a proficient artist.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One filter I’d like to
    bypass right away is edges. I became aware of this when teaching children to
    paint, and it is the same<br />filter still firmly in place in adulthood.
    Our perceptions dictate that objects must have strong outlines and defining
    edges.

    <span class="text-big"><strong>Contour Drawing Warm-Up</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
    <br />One excellent warm-up practice is to do a contour drawing. There are
    two kinds of contour drawings: regular and blind.<br />Both types involve
    placing your pencil on a piece of paper and not lifting it until the drawing
    is complete. The idea is that as<br />your eyes are moving across the
    subject you have chosen, your pencil is moving across the paper in the same
    manner.<br />How do these two types of contour drawings differ? The answer
    lies in whether or not you look at your hand while in the<br />process of
    drawing. In a regular contour drawing you have the freedom to look at both
    the subject and your drawing as you<br />work. But a blind contour drawing,
    as the name suggests, requires that you lock your gaze on the subject
    entirely, never<br />looking down at your hand as you draw.<br />Now,
    contour drawing may sound like a waste of your time, but the point is to
    train your eye and hand to move together at<br />the same time and at the
    same pace. This ultimately forces your eye to slow down and more carefully
    observe the object so<br />your hand can keep up. Just give contour drawing
    a shot—it’ll be fun, I promise!

<p>
    <strong>Blind Contour Drawing</strong><br />Choose a starting point on the
    object, then place a piece of paper under your drawing hand and put the
    pencil down on the paper. T urn your body so you can’t<br />peek back at
    your hand. As you start drawing, your eyes and your hand should be in sync.
    T hat is, as your eye moves slowly around the object, your hand<br />should
    record the exact part of the image on which your eyes are focusing at any
    given time. Let your eye explore each shape and area of the object as
    your<br />hand does the same. Don’t lift your pencil from the paper until
    the drawing is complete—and no peeking at your paper! When you’re finished,
    you should end<br />up with a scribble that kind of resembles your subject.

    <br /><strong>Regular Contour Drawing</strong><br />Begin this drawing in
    the same way, only don’t bother turning your body so that you can’t see your
    hand. T his time, you can freely look back and forth from<br />your paper to
    the subject, but you still can’t lift your pencil from the paper until the
    drawing is complete. No cheating! Your regular contour drawing will more<br />closely
    resemble the actual subject.
