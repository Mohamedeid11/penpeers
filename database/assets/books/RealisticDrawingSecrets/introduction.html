You’re reading this book, which means you’ve met the only criteria I have: a desire to learn.<br>Drawing is a very learnable skill. If you haven’t learned to draw, your drawings are weak or some art teacher told you to<br>take up knitting instead, you just haven’t had the right instruction. I’m not promising that you’ll become Leonardo da Vinci by<br>the end of this book, but I do believe you will draw better than you have ever hoped. All you must do is apply (and practice!)<br>the drawing tools taught in this book. You’ll soon discover that learning to draw is less about talent and more about learning<br>to perceive the world around you differently.<br>GETTING THERE<br>My own artistic journey is just colorful enough to make for a good, and hopefully inspirational, story.<br>I’d always found certain types of art easy. That is, I could look at some things and somehow draw them fairly accurately.<br>I grew up in a small mining town in northern Idaho where the public school system could barely afford textbooks, let alone an<br>arts curriculum. My parents did the best they could to encourage my talent, but when I announced that I was going to be a<br>professional artist, they could barely mask their horror. Art was fine as a hobby, but a career? After much soul-searching,<br>they bravely sent me off to a nearby community college to study commercial art.<br>I soon found myself floundering. Lessons consisted of the professors placing a mess of white shapes on a table and having<br>us draw them. White balls, white shoes, white drapery and, well, more white stuff. I could never figure out the point. What is<br>so special about white? Then we got to paint. We did paintings of the white stuff in the primary colors of red, blue and<br>yellow. Egads! I just wanted to draw something that really looked like something.<br>After a year of not getting it, I changed majors and figured my art career was probably going to become a hobby after all.<br>I envisioned myself as a gray-haired lady puttering with bad oil paints on Saturday mornings. For several years I drifted from<br>college to college and major to major. I became the consummate professional student.<br>Then one day I attended a gallery opening of watercolor paintings. As I wandered around the room studying the paintings,<br>it hit me: I can do this! I can paint at least this well. So what was the difference between this artist and me? How did she get<br>her own art show and not me? My husband dryly provided the answer: “She did it.” She took the time and effort to actually<br>create enough art for a one-woman show. I made up my mind then and there that I was going to be an artist, too, despite my<br>collegiate setbacks.<br>THE STO RY CO NTINUES<br>After some time as a watercolorist, I found myself developing a fascinating use for my drawing skills: I started working at a<br>crime lab as a forensic artist. Part of my job was sketching crime scenes. I would love to tell you that I was originally hired<br>to work there because I was a brilliant artist with the crime-solving ability of Sherlock Holmes, but that would be stretching<br>it. In 1985, I attended a short course on composite drawing at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. Composite drawings<br>are the “Wanted” drawings you see of criminal suspects on the nightly news. They are usually created by combining<br>separate facial features that the victim or witness of a crime selects from a book of faces. The composite is used to identify<br>an unknown suspect. I was invited to the course only because the FBI wanted participants from a variety of regions<br>throughout the United States. My face-drawing skills were still dreadful at this point, but I was inspired to improve.<br>I worked hard and paid attention to what it would take to do a good job. I became Carrie Parks, Pencil Sleuth. I loved<br>drawing faces and became addicted to forensic art. I finally finished my college degree with a double major in social science<br>and art—with honors, no less. My motto was, “I have a pencil, and I’m not afraid to use it!”<br>Now my husband and I travel across the nation teaching composite drawing and forensic art courses. We have taught all<br>kinds of people of varying skill levels, from FBI and Secret Service agents to civilian adults and children. We have won<br>awards for our teaching methods, and I’ve even written a book exclusively on drawing faces. And to think, at one point I<br>thought art could only be a hobby!</p><div class="page-break" style="page-break-after:always;"><span style="display:none;">&nbsp;</span></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SO , THE PO INT O F THIS IS …<br>You, too, can realize your dream of becoming an artist if you set your mind to it. This book aims to teach you what it takes to<br>do just that. I’m not going to set a bunch of stuff in front of you and expect miracles. Instead, I’ll cover all the essentials, teaching you the secrets of realistic drawing one step at a time. Before you know it, you’ll be turning out picturesque<br>landscapes, stellar portraits—any subject that you like!<br>In my many years of teaching art, I’ve discovered that there are certain characteristics that define success as an artist.<br>My short list is as follows:<br>Desire. Desire doesn’t just mean wanting something, but wanting it badly enough that you’re willing to try a different<br>approach to get it. At first, you might not like it, might not do well trying it, or might not find it useful, but still you are<br>willing to try. This characteristic is what will allow you to grow and improve your artistic skills.<br>Interest. It’s hard to whip up a fascination for drawing Harley-Davidson motorcycles when you love to ride horses. You<br>need to draw what interests you, and practice your drawing on the things that interest you.<br>Good instruction. This is my role. Good instruction is not up to the student, it is up to the teacher. If you’ve ever taken a<br>class where you were told to draw something in a particular way but were never told why or how, you haven’t failed—<br>your teacher has. If it’s meaningless to you, you’ll never learn. Art needs to be stepped out, explained and demonstrated.<br>If it were as simple as just drawing something, you would already be doing it!<br>Focus. The artists who develop the best drawing skills usually have the best observational skills. This means having an eye<br>for the details as well as the overall picture. This takes concentration and training but is well worth the effort.<br>Practice. To be good at anything, you need practice. One of my students was so thrilled by his new skills that he started<br>drawing everybody, everywhere. I believe he had a sketchbook firmly in hand wherever he went. Of course, he is a<br>fantastic artist now because he practiced his skill.<br>Talent. Some artists may have it, but you don’t have to have natural talent to draw well. In my opinion, it takes far more<br>training and skill development than actual talent to become a successful artist. Anyone can learn to draw by applying her<br>desire and interest. I’ll supply the good instruction if you focus on and practice what you’re learning. Everyone will then<br>be convinced that you had talent all along!</p>
