    I AM STILL RATHER taken aback by the reception given to my book, A Brief
    History of Time. It has been on The New York Times best-seller list for
    thirty-seven weeks and on The Sunday Times of London list for twenty-eight
    weeks. (It was published later in Britain than in the United States.) It is
    being translated into twenty languages (twenty-one if you count American as
    different from English). This was much more than I expected when I first had
    the idea in 1982 of writing a popular book about the universe. My intention
    was partly to earn money to pay my daughter’s school fees. (In fact, by the
    time the book actually appeared, she was in her last year of school.) But
    the main reason was that I wanted to explain how far I felt we had come in
    our understanding of the universe: how we might be near finding a complete
    theory that would describe the universe and everything in it. If I were
    going to spend the time and effort to write a book, I wanted it to get to as
    many people as possible. My previous technical books had been published by
    Cambridge University Press. That publisher had done a good job, but I didn’t
    feel that it would really be geared to the sort of mass market that I wanted
    to reach. I therefore contacted a literary agent, Al Zuckerman, who had been
    introduced to me as the brother-in-law of a colleague. I gave him a draft of
    the first chapter and explained that I wanted it to be the sort of book that
    would sell in airport book stalls. He told me there was no chance of that.
    It might sell well to academics and students, but a book like that couldn’t
    break into Jeffrey Archer territory. I gave Zuckerman a first draft of the
    book in 1984. He sent it to several publishers and recommended that I accept
    an offer from Norton, a fairly upmarket American book firm. But I decided
    instead to take an offer from Bantam Books, a publisher more oriented toward
    the popular market. Though Bantam had not specialized in publishing science
    books, their books were widely available in airport book stalls. That they
    accepted my book was probably because of the interest in it taken by one of
    their editors, Peter Guzzardi. He took his job very seriously and made me
    rewrite the book to make it understandable to nonscientists like himself
    Each time I sent him a rewritten chapter, he sent back a long list of
    objections and questions he wanted me to clarify. At times I thought the
    process would never end. But he was right: It is a much better book as a
    result. Shortly after I accepted Bantam’s offer, I got pneumonia. I had to
    have a tracheostomy operation that removed my voice. For a time I could
    communicate only by raising my eyebrows when someone pointed to letters on a
    card. It would have been quite impossible to finish the book but for the
    computer program I had been given. It was a bit slow, but then I think
    slowly, so it suited me quite well. With it I almost completely rewrote my
    first draft in response to Guzzardi’s urgings. I was helped in this revision
    by one of my students, Brian Whitt. I had been very impressed by Jacob
    Bronowski’s television series, The Ascent of Man. (Such a sexist title would
    not be allowed today.) It gave a feeling for the achievement of the human
    race in developing from primitive savages only fifteen thousand years ago to
    our present state. I wanted to convey a similar feeling for our progress
    toward a complete understanding of the laws that govern the universe. I was
    sure that nearly everyone was interested in how the universe operates, but
    most people cannot follow mathematical equations—I don’t care much for
    equations myself. This is partly because it is difficult for me to write
    them down but mainly because I don’t have an intuitive feeling for
    equations. Instead, I think in pictorial terms, and my aim in the book was
    to describe these mental images in words, with the help of familiar
    analogies and a few diagrams. In this way, I hoped that most people would be
    able to share in the excitement and feeling of achievement in the remarkable
    progress that has been made in physics in the last twenty-five years. Still,
    even if one avoids mathematics, some of the ideas are unfamiliar and
    difficult to explain. This posed a problem: Should I try to explain them and
    risk people being confused, or should I gloss over the difficulties? Some
    unfamiliar concepts, such as the fact that observers moving at different
    velocities measure different time intervals between the same pair of events,
    were not essential to the picture I wanted to draw. Therefore I felt I could
    just mention them but not go into depth. But other difficult ideas were
    basic to what I wanted to get across. There were two such concepts in
    particular that I felt I had to include. One was the so-called sum over
    histories. This is the idea that there is not just a single history for the
    universe. Rather, there is a collection of every possible history for the
    universe, and all these histories are equally real (whatever that may mean).
    The other idea, which is necessary to make mathematical sense of the sum
    over histories, is “imaginary time.” With hindsight, I now feel that I
    should have put more effort into explaining these two very difficult
    concepts, particularly imaginary time, which seems to be the thing in the
    book with which people have the most trouble. However, it is not really
    necessary to understand exactly what imaginary time is—just that it is
    different from what we call real time. When the book was nearing
    publication, a scientist who was sent an advance copy to review for Nature
    magazine was appalled to find it full of errors, with misplaced and
    erroneously labeled photographs and diagrams. He called Bantam, who were
    equally appalled and decided that same day to recall and scrap the entire
    printing. They spent three intense weeks correcting and rechecking the
    entire book, and it was ready in time to be in the bookstores by the April
    publication date. By then, Time magazine had published a profile of me. Even
    so, the editors were taken by surprise by the demand. The book is in its
    seventeenth printing in America and its tenth in Britain.* Why did so many
    people buy it? It is difficult for me to be sure that I’m objective, so I
    think I will go by what other people said. I found most of the reviews,
    although favorable, rather unilluminating. They tended to follow the
    formula: Stephen Hawking has Lou Gehrig’s disease (in American reviews), or
    motor neurone disease (in British reviews). He is confined to a wheelchair,
    cannot speak, and can only move x number of fingers (where x seems to vary
    from one to three, according to which inaccurate article the reviewer read
    about me). Yet he has written this book about the biggest question of all:
    Where did we come from and where are we going? The answer that Hawking
    proposes is that the universe is neither created nor destroyed: It just is.
    In order to formulate this idea, Hawking introduces the concept of imaginary
    time, which I (the reviewer) find a little hard to follow. Still, if Hawking
    is right and we do find a complete unified theory, we shall really know the
    mind of God. (In the proof stage I nearly cut the last sentence in the book,
    which was that we would know the mind of God. Had I done so, the sales might
    have been halved.) Rather more perceptive (I felt) was an article in The
    Independent, a London newspaper, which said that even a serious scientific
    book like A Brief History of Time could become, a cult book My wife was
    horrified, but I was rather flattered to have my book compared to Zen and
    the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I hope, like Zen, that it gives people
    the feeling that they need not be cut off from the great intellectual and
    philosophical questions. Undoubtedly, the human interest story of how I have
    managed to be a theoretical physicist despite my disability has helped. But
    those who bought the book from the human interest angle may have been
    disappointed because it contains only a couple of references to my
    condition. The book was intended as a history of the universe, not of me.
    This has not prevented accusations that Bantam shamefully exploited my
    illness and that I cooperated with this by allowing my picture to appear on
    the cover. In fact, under my contract I had no control over the cover. I
    did, however, manage to persuade Bantam to use a better photograph on the
    British edition than the miserable and out-of-date photo used on the
    American edition. Bantam will not change the American cover, however,
    because it says that the American public now identifies that with the book.
    It has also been suggested that people buy the book because they have read
    reviews of it or because it is on the best-seller list, but they don’t read
    it; they just have it in the bookcase or on the coffee table, thereby
    getting credit for having it without taking the effort of having to
    understand it. I am sure this happens, but I don’t know that it is any more
    so than for most other serious books, including the Bible and Shakespeare.
    On the other hand, I know that at least some people must have read it
    because each day I get a pile of letters about my book, many asking
    questions or making detailed comments that indicate that they have read it,
    even if they do not understand all of it. I also get stopped by strangers on
    the street who tell me how much they enjoyed it. Of course, I am more easily
    identified and more distinctive, if not distinguished, than most authors.
    But the frequency with which I receive such public congratulations (to the
    great embarrassment of my nine-year-old son) seems to indicate that at least
    a proportion of those who buy the book actually do read it. People now ask
    me what I am going to do next. I feel I can hardly write a sequel to A Brief
    History of Time. What would I call it? A Longer History of Time? Beyond the
    End of Time? Son of Time? My agent has suggested that I allow a film to be
    made about my life. But neither I nor my family would have any self-respect
    left if we let ourselves be portrayed by actors. The same would be true to a
    lesser extent if I allowed and helped someone to write my life. Of course, I
    cannot stop someone from writing my life independently, as long as it is not
    libelous, but I try to put them off by saying I’m considering writing my
    autobiography. Maybe I will. But I’m in no hurry. I have a lot of science
    that I want to do first.
