    >HE FIRST THIRTY years of this century saw the emergence of three theories
    that radically altered man’s view of physics and of reality itself.
    Physicists are still trying to explore their implications and to fit them
    together. The three theories are the special theory of relativity (1905),
    the general theory of relativity (1915), and the theory of quantum mechanics
    (c. 1926). Albert Einstein was largely responsible for the first, was
    entirely responsible for the second, and played a major role in the
    development of the third. Yet Einstein never accepted quantum mechanics
    because of its element of chance and uncertainty. His feelings were summed
    up in his oft-quoted statement “God does not play dice.” Most physicists,
    however, readily accepted both special relativity and quantum mechanics
    because they described effects that could be directly observed. General
    relativity, on the other hand, was largely ignored because it seemed too
    complicated mathematically, was not testable in the laboratory, and was a
    purely classical theory that did not seem compatible with quantum mechanics.
    Thus, general relativity remained in the doldrums for nearly fifty years.
    The great extension of astronomical observations that began early in the
    1960s brought about a revival of interest in the classical theory of general
    relativity because it seemed that many of the new phenomena that were being
    discovered, such as quasars, pulsars, and compact X-ray sources, indicated
    the existence of very strong gravitational fields—fields that could be
    described only by general relativity. Quasars are starlike objects that must
    be many times brighter than entire galaxies if they are as distant as the
    reddening of their spectra indicates; pulsars are the rapidly blinking
    remnants of supernova explosions, believed to be ultradense neutron stars;
    compact X-ray sources, revealed by instruments aboard space vehicles, may
    also be neutron stars or may be hypothetical objects of still higher
    density, namely black holes. One of the problems facing physicists who
    sought to apply general relativity to these newly discovered or hypothetical
    objects was to make it compatible with quantum mechanics. Within the past
    few years there have been developments that give rise to the hope that
    before too long we shall have a fully consistent quantum theory of gravity,
    one that will agree with general relativity for macroscopic objects and
    will, one hopes, be free of the mathematical infinities that have long
    bedeviled other quantum field theories. These developments have to do with
    certain recently discovered quantum effects associated with black holes,
    which provide a remarkable connection between black holes and the laws of
    thermodynamics. Let me describe briefly how a black hole might be created.
    Imagine a star with a mass ten times that of the sun. During most of its
    lifetime of about a billion years, the star will generate heat at its center
    by converting hydrogen into helium. The energy released will create
    sufficient pressure to support the star against its own gravity, giving rise
    to an object with a radius about five times the radius of the sun. The
    escape velocity from the surface of such a star would be about a thousand
    kilometers per second. That is to say, an object fired vertically upward
    from the surface of the star with a velocity of less than a thousand
    kilometers per second would be dragged back by the gravitational field of
    the star and would return to the surface, whereas an object with a velocity
    greater than that would escape to infinity. When the star had exhausted its
    nuclear fuel, there would be nothing to maintain the outward pressure, and
    the star would begin to collapse because of its own gravity. As the star
    shrank, the gravitational field at the surface would become stronger and the
    escape velocity would increase. By the time the radius had got down to
    thirty kilometers, the escape velocity would have increased to 300,000
    kilometers per second, the velocity of light. After that time any light
    emitted from the star would not be able to escape to infinity but would be
    dragged back by the gravitational field. According to the special theory of
    relativity, nothing can travel faster than light, so that if light cannot
    escape, nothing else can either. The result would be a black hole: a region
    of space-time from which it is not possible to escape to infinity. The
    boundary of the black hole is called the event horizon. It corresponds to a
    wave front of light from the star that just fails to escape to infinity but
    remains hovering at the Schwarzschild radius: 2 GM/√c, where G is Newton’s
    constant of gravity, M is the mass of the star, and c is the velocity of
    light. For a star of about ten solar masses, the Schwarzschild radius is
    about thirty kilometers. There is now fairly good observational evidence to
    suggest that black holes of about this size exist in double-star systems
    such as the X-ray source known as Cygnus X-I. There might also be quite a
    number of very much smaller black holes scattered around the universe,
    formed not by the collapse of stars but by the collapse of highly compressed
    regions in the hot, dense medium that is believed to have existed shortly
    after the big bang in which the universe originated. Such “primordial” black
    holes are of greatest interest for the quantum effects I shall describe
    here. A black hole weighing a billion tons (about the mass of a mountain)
    would have a radius of about 10 -13 centimeter (the size of a neutron or a
    proton). It could be in orbit either around the sun or around the center of
    the galaxy. The first hint that there might be a connection between black
    holes and thermodynamics came with the mathematical discovery in 1970 that
    the surface area of the event horizon, the boundary of a black hole, has the
    property that it always increases when additional matter or radiation falls
    into the black hole. Moreover, if two black holes collide and merge to form
    a single black hole, the area of the event horizon around the resulting
    black hole is greater than the sum of the areas of the event horizons around
    the original black holes. These properties suggest that there is a
    resemblance between the area of the event horizon of a black hole and the
    concept of entropy in thermodynamics. Entropy can be regarded as a measure
    of the disorder of a system or, equivalently, as a lack of knowledge of its
    precise state. The famous second law of thermodynamics says that entropy
    always increases with time. The analogy between the properties of black
    holes and the laws of thermodynamics has been extended by James M. Bardeen
    of the University of Washington, Brandon Carter, who is now at the Meudon
    Observatory, and me. The first law of thermodynamics says that a small
    change in the entropy of a system is accompanied by a proportional change in
    the energy of the system. The factor of proportionality is called the
    temperature of the system. Bardeen, Carter, and I found a similar law
    relating to the change in mass of a black hole to a change in the area of
    the event horizon. Here the factor of proportionality involves a quantity
    called the surface gravity, which is a measure of the strength of the
    gravitational field at the event horizon. If one accepts that the area of
    the event horizon is analogous to entropy, then it would seem that the
    surface gravity is analogous to temperature. The resemblance is strengthened
    by the fact that the surface gravity turns out to be the same at all points
    on the event horizon, just as the temperature is the same everywhere in a
    body at thermal equilibrium. Although there is clearly a similarity between
    entropy and the area of the event horizon, it was not obvious to us how the
    area could be identified as the entropy of a black hole. What would be meant
    by the entropy of a black hole? The crucial suggestion was made in 1972 by
    Jacob D. Bekenstein, who was then a graduate student at Princeton University
    and is now at the University of the Negev in Israel. It goes like this. When
    a black hole is created by gravitational collapse, it rapidly settles down
    to a stationary state that is characterized by only three parameters: the
    mass, the angular momentum, and the electric charge. Apart from these three
    properties the black hole preserves no other details of the object that
    collapsed. This conclusion, known as the theorem “A black hole has no hair,”
    was proved by the combined work of Carter, Werner Israel of the University
    of Alberta, David C. Robinson of King’s College, London, and me. The no-hair
    theorem implies that a large amount of information is lost in a
    gravitational collapse. For example, the final black-hole state is
    independent of whether the body that collapsed was composed of matter or
    antimatter, and whether it was spherical or highly irregular in shape. In
    other words, a black hole of a given mass, angular momentum, and electric
    charge could have been formed by the collapse of any one of a large number
    of different configurations of matter. Indeed, if quantum effects are
    neglected, the number of configurations would be infinite, since the black
    hole could have been formed by the collapse of a cloud of an indefinitely
    large number of particles of indefinitely low mass. The uncertainty
    principle of quantum mechanics implies, however, that a particle of mass m
    behaves like a wave of wavelength h/mc, where h is Planck’s constant (the
    small number 6.62 X 10 -27 erg-second) and c is the velocity of light. In
    order for a cloud of particles to be able to collapse to form a black hole,
    it would seem necessary for this wavelength to be smaller than the size of
    the black hole that would be formed. It therefore appears that the number of
    configurations that could form a black hole of a given mass, angular
    momentum, and electric charge, although very large, may be finite.
    Bekenstein suggested that one could interpret the logarithm of this number
    as the entropy of a black hole. The logarithm of the number would be a
    measure of the amount of information that was irretrievably lost during the
    collapse through the event horizon when a black hole was created. The
    apparently fatal flaw in Bekenstein’s suggestion was that if a black hole
    has a finite entropy that is proportional to the area of its event horizon,
    it also ought to have a finite temperature, which would be proportional to
    its surface gravity. This would imply that a black hole could be in
    equilibrium with thermal radiation at some temperature other than zero. Yet
    according to classical concepts no such equilibrium is possible, since the
    black hole would absorb any thermal radiation that fell on it but by
    definition would not be able to emit anything in return. This paradox
    remained until early 1974, when I was investigating what the behavior of
    matter in the vicinity of a black hole would be according to quantum
    mechanics. To my great surprise, I found that the black hole seemed to emit
    particles at a steady rate. Like everyone else at that time, I accepted the
    dictum that a black hole could not emit anything. I therefore put quite a
    lot of effort into trying to get rid of this embarrassing effect. It refused
    to go away, so that in the end I had to accept it. What finally convinced me
    that it was a real physical process was that the outgoing particles have a
    spectrum that is precisely thermal; the black hole creates and emits
    particles just as if it were an ordinary hot body with a temperature that is
    proportional to the surface gravity and inversely proportional to the mass.
    This made Bekenstein’s suggestion that a black hole had a finite entropy
    fully consistent, since it implied that a black hole could be in thermal
    equilibrium at some finite temperature other than zero.

    Since that time, the mathematical evidence that black holes can emit
    thermally has been confirmed by a number of other people with various
    different approaches. One way to understand the emission is as follows.
    Quantum mechanics implies that the whole of space is filled with pairs of
    “virtual” particles and antiparticles that are constantly materializing in
    pairs, separating, and then coming together again and annihilating each
    other. These particles are called virtual because, unlike “real” particles,
    they cannot be observed directly with a particle detector. Their indirect
    effects can nonetheless be measured, and their existence has been confirmed
    by a small shift (the “Lamb shift”) they produce in the spectrum of light
    from excited hydrogen atoms. Now, in the presence of a black hole one member
    of a pair of virtual particles may fall into the hole, leaving the other
    member without a partner with which to annihilate. The forsaken particle or
    antiparticle may fall into the black hole after its partner, but it may also
    escape to infinity, where it appears to be radiation emitted by the black
    hole. Another way of looking at the process is to regard the member of the
    pair of particles that falls into the black hole—the antiparticle, say—as
    being really a particle that is traveling backward in time. Thus, the
    antiparticle falling into the black hole can be regarded as a particle
    coming out of the black hole but traveling backward in time. When the
    particle reaches the point at which the particle-antiparticle pair
    originally materialized, it is scattered by the gravitational field so that
    it travels forward in time. Quantum mechanics therefore allows a particle to
    escape from inside a black hole, something that is not allowed in classical
    mechanics. There are, however, many other situations in atomic and nuclear
    physics where there is some kind of barrier that particles should not be
    able to penetrate on classical principles but that they are able to tunnel
    through on quantum-mechanical principles. The thickness of the barrier
    around a black hole is proportional to the size of the black hole. This
    means that very few particles can escape from a black hole as large as the
    one hypothesized to exist in Cygnus X-I, but that particles can leak very
    rapidly out of smaller black holes. Detailed calculations show that the
    emitted particles have a thermal spectrum corresponding to a temperature
    that increases rapidly as the mass of the black hole decreases. For a black
    hole with a mass of the sun, the temperature is only about a ten-millionth
    of a degree above absolute zero. The thermal radiation leaving a black hole
    with that temperature would be completely swamped by the general background
    of radiation in the universe. On the other hand, a black hole with a mass of
    only a billion tons—that is, a primordial black hole, roughly the size of a
    proton—would have a temperature of some 120 billion degrees Kelvin, which
    corresponds to an energy of some ten million electron volts. At such a
    temperature a black hole would be able to create electron-positron pairs and
    particles of zero mass, such as photons, neutrinos, and gravitons (the
    presumed carriers of gravitational energy). A primordial black hole would
    release energy at the rate of 6,000 megawatts, equivalent to the output of
    six large nuclear power plants. As a black hole emits particles, its mass
    and size steadily decrease. This makes it easier for more particles to
    tunnel out, and so the emission will continue at an ever-increasing rate
    until eventually the black hole radiates itself out of existence. In the
    long run, every black hole in the universe will evaporate in this way. For
    large black holes, however, the time it will take is very long indeed; a
    black hole with the mass of the sun will last for about 10 66 years. On the
    other hand, a primordial black hole should have almost completely evaporated
    in the ten billion years that have elapsed since the big bang, the beginning
    of the universe as we know it. Such black holes should now be emitting hard
    gamma rays with an energy of about 100 million electron volts. Calculations
    made by Don N. Page, then of the California Institute of Technology, and me,
    based on measurements of the cosmic background of gamma radiation made by
    the satellite SAS-2, show that the average density of primordial black holes
    in the universe must be less than about two hundred per cubic light-year.
    The local density in our galaxy could be a million times higher than this
    figure if primordial black holes were concentrated in the “halo” of
    galaxies—the thin cloud of rapidly moving stars in which each galaxy is
    embedded—rather than being uniformly distributed throughout the universe.
    This would imply that the primordial black hole closest to the earth is
    probably at least as far away as the planet Pluto. The final stage of the
    evaporation of a black hole would proceed so rapidly that it would end in a
    tremendous explosion. How powerful this explosion would be would depend on
    how many different species of elementary particles there are. If, as is now
    widely believed, all particles are made up of perhaps six different
    varieties of quarks, the final explosion would have an energy equivalent to
    about ten million one-megaton hydrogen bombs. On the other hand, an
    alternative theory put forward by R. Hagedorn of CERN, the European
    Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, argues that there is an
    infinite number of elementary particles of higher and higher mass. As a
    black hole got smaller and hotter, it would emit a larger and larger number
    of different species of particles and would produce an explosion perhaps
    100,000 times more powerful than the one calculated on the quark hypothesis.
    Hence the observation of a black-hole explosion would provide very important
    information on elementary particle physics, information that might not be
    available any other way.

    A black-hole explosion would produce a massive outpouring of high-energy
    gamma rays. Although they might be observed by gamma-ray detectors on
    satellites or balloons, it would be difficult to fly a detector large enough
    to have a reasonable chance of intercepting a significant number of
    gamma-ray photons from one explosion. One possibility would be to employ a
    space shuttle to build a large gamma-ray detector in orbit. An easier and
    much cheaper alternative would be to let the earth’s upper atmosphere serve
    as a detector. A high-energy gamma ray plunging into the atmosphere will
    create a shower of electronpositron pairs, which initially will be traveling
    through the atmosphere faster than light can. (Light is slowed down by
    interactions with the air molecules.) Thus the electrons and positrons will
    set up a kind of sonic boom, or shock wave, in the electromagnetic field.
    Such a shock wave, called Cerenkov radiation, could be detected from the
    ground as a flash of visible light. A preliminary experiment by Neil A.
    Porter and Trevor C. Weekes of University College, Dublin, indicates that if
    black holes explode the way Hagedorn’s theory predicts, there are fewer than
    two black-hole explosions per cubic light-year per century in our region of
    the galaxy. This would imply that the density of primordial black holes is
    less than 100 million per cubic light-year. It should be possible to greatly
    increase the sensitivity of such observations. Even if they do not yield any
    positive evidence of primordial black holes, they will be very valuable. By
    placing a low upper limit on the density of such black holes, the
    observations will indicate that the early universe must have been very
    smooth and nonturbulent. The big bang resembles a black-hole explosion but
    on a vastly larger scale. One therefore hopes that an understanding of how
    black holes create particles will lead to a similar understanding of how the
    big bang created everything in the universe. In a black hole, matter
    collapses and is lost forever, but new matter is created in its place. It
    may therefore be that there was an earlier phase of the universe in which
    matter collapsed, to be re-created in the big bang. If the matter that
    collapses to form a black hole has a net electric charge, the resulting
    black hole will carry the same charge. This means that the black hole will
    tend to attract those members of the virtual particle-antiparticle pairs
    that have the opposite charge and repel those that have a like charge. The
    black hole will therefore preferentially emit particles with a charge of the
    same sign as itself and so will rapidly lose its charge. Similarly, if the
    collapsing matter has a net angular momentum, the resulting black hole will
    be rotating and will preferentially emit particles that carry away its
    angular momentum. The reason a black hole “remembers” the electric charge,
    angular momentum, and mass of the matter that collapsed and “forgets”
    everything else is that these three quantities are coupled to long-range
    fields: in the case of charge the electromagnetic field, and in the case of
    angular momentum and mass the gravitational field. Experiments by Robert H.
    Dicke of Princeton University and Vladimir Braginsky of Moscow State
    University have indicated that there is no long-range field associated with
    the quantum property designated baryon number. (Baryons are the class of
    particles including the proton and the neutron.) Hence, a black hole formed
    out of the collapse of a collection of baryons would forget its baryon
    number and radiate equal quantities of baryons and antibaryons. Therefore,
    when the black hole disappeared, it would violate one of the most cherished
    laws of particle physics, the law of baryon conservation. Although
    Bekenstein’s hypothesis that black holes have a finite entropy requires for
    its consistency that black holes should radiate thermally, at first it seems
    a complete miracle that the detailed quantum-mechanical calculations of
    particle creation should give rise to emission with a thermal spectrum. The
    explanation is that the emitted particles tunnel out of the black hole from
    a region of which an external observer has no knowledge other than its mass,
    angular momentum, and electric charge. This means that all combinations or
    configurations of emitted particles that have the same energy, angular
    momentum, and electric charge are equally probable. Indeed, it is possible
    that the black hole could emit a television set or the works of Proust in
    ten leatherbound volumes, but the number of configurations of particles that
    correspond to these exotic possibilities is vanishingly small. By far the
    largest number of configurations correspond to emission with a spectrum that
    is nearly thermal. The emission from black holes has an added degree of
    uncertainty, or unpredictability, over and above that normally associated
    with quantum mechanics. In classical mechanics one can predict the results
    of measuring both the position and the velocity of a particle. In quantum
    mechanics the uncertainty principle says that only one of these measurements
    can be predicted; the observer can predict the result of measuring either
    the position or the velocity but not both. Alternatively, he can predict the
    result of measuring one combination of position and velocity. Thus, the
    observer’s ability to make definite predictions is in effect cut in half.
    With black holes the situation is even worse. Since the particles emitted by
    a black hole come from a region of which the observer has very limited
    knowledge, he cannot definitely predict the position or the velocity of a
    particle or any combination of the two; all he can predict is the
    probabilities that certain particles will be emitted. It therefore seems
    that Einstein was doubly wrong when he said, “God does not play dice.”
    Consideration of particle emission from black holes would seem to suggest
    that God not only plays dice but also sometimes throws them where they
    cannot be seen.
