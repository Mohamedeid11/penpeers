    Welcome to Learn <i>Adobe Illustrator CC for Graphic Design</i> and
    Illustration! This product uses a combination of text and video to help you
    learn the basics of graphic design and illustration with Adobe Illustrator
    CC along with other skills that you will need to get your first job as a
    graphic designer or illustrator. Adobe Illustrator CC is a powerful program
    for creating illustrations, logos, icons, and graphic designs composed of
    type and vector art that can be scaled, transformed, recolored, and reshaped
    at any time without any loss of quality. Various editable effects can be
    applied to shapes or type to further stylize the objects in your artwork.
    You can also use Illustrator to output your artwork as printed pieces or to
    export the artwork to video and web applications for viewing on screen and
    mobile devices.

        >About This Product</span
    >
</h2>
<p>
    Learn <i>Adobe Illustrator CC for Graphic Design</i> and Illustration was
    created by a team of expert instructors, writers, and editors with years of
    experience in helping beginning learners get their start with the cool
    creative tools from Adobe. Our aim is not only to teach you the basics of
    the art of graphic design and illustration with Illustrator, but to give you
    an introduction to the associated “soft” skills (like design principles and
    project management) that you’ll need for your first job.
</p>
<p>
    We’ve built the training around the objectives for the Graphic Design and
    Illustration Using Adobe Illustrator CC Adobe Certified Associate Exam, and
    if you master the topics covered in this book and video you’ll be in good
    shape to take the exam. But even if certification isn’t your goal, you’ll
    still find this training will give you an excellent foundation for your
    future work in graphic design and illustration.
</p>
<p>
    This product is a unique learning system that uses video and text in
    partnership. You’ll experience this partnership in action in the Web
    Edition, which lives on your Account page at peachpit.com. The Web Edition
    contains 6 hours of video—the heart of the training—embedded in an online
    eBook that supports the video training and provides background material. The
    eBook material is also sold separately for offline reading as a printed book
    or an eBook in a variety of formats. The Web Edition also includes dozens of
    interactive review questions you can use to evaluate your progress, as well
    as a chapter on principles of design (Chapter 19). Purchase of the book in
    any format entitles you to free access to the Web Edition (instructions for
    accessing it follow later in this section).
</p>
<p>
    Most chapters provide step-by-step instructions for creating a specific
    project or learning a specific technique. Other chapters acquaint you with
    other skills and concepts that you’ll come to depend on as you use the
    software in the workaday world. You can follow the book from start to finish
    or work through only the chapters that meet your interests and needs. Many
    chapters include several optional tasks that let you further explore the
    features you’ve already learned.
</p>
<p>
    Each chapter opens with two lists of objectives. One list lays out the
    learning objectives: the specific tasks you’ll learn in the chapter. The
    second list shows the ACA exam objectives that are covered in the chapter. A
    table at the end of the book guides you to coverage of all of the exam
    objectives in the book or video.

        >Resetting the Preferences to Their Default Settings</span
    >
</h2>
<p>
    Adobe Illustrator CC lets you determine how the program looks and behaves
    using the extensive options in Illustrator CC &gt; Preferences (Mac OS) or
    Edit &gt; Preferences (Windows). These settings for parameters such as tool
    settings and the default unit of measurement are stored in a file called
    Adobe Illustrator Prefs (Mac OS) or AIPrefs (Windows). To ensure that the
    preferences and default settings of your Adobe Illustrator program match
    those used in this book, you can reset your preference settings to their
    defaults. If you’re using software installed on computers in a classroom,
    don’t make any changes to the system configuration without first checking
    with your instructor.
</p>
<p>To reset your preferences to their default settings, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li style="margin-left: 40px">Quit Adobe Illustrator CC.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 40px">
        Hold down the <code>Cmd+Opt+Shift</code> keys (Mac OS) or
        <code>Ctrl+Alt+Shift</code> keys (Windows).
    </li>
    <li style="margin-left: 40px">
        Continue to hold the keys and start Adobe Illustrator CC.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-left: 40px">
        When the program’s splash screen appears, release the keys. Your
        preferences will be deleted and the program’s default settings will be
        restored.
    </li>
</ol>
