    >The Beginning of My Journey</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  <span class="text-huge" style="color: #000"><strong>I</strong></span
  ><span style="color: #000">
    have always had a burning desire to understand how the universe works, what
    life is all about, and the meaning and purpose for which I am here. In
    retrospect, I can see that my entire life has been devoted to my search for
    truth and understanding.</span
  ><br /><span style="color: #000"
    >I was brought up in a very intellectual, well-educated, nonreligious
    family. My parents were essentially atheists, and very early on, I remember
    having the attitude that a belief in God was a human fabrication, a fantasy,
    a superstition created to help people feel better about the totally
    unexplained, and unexplainable, predicament we seem to find ourselves in.
    Human existence, or any other kind of existence, was simply an accident of
    nature and had no particularly fathomable meaning. I preferred to admit that
    I didn’t know how we got here or why, rather than to adopt a simplistic
    explanation merely to gain a sense of security. I believed that truth was
    rational and anything that couldn’t be proved scientifically didn’t exist. I
    also felt somewhat condescending toward people who were weak enough to have
    to make up a god to believe in.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >The positive side of this upbringing was that I didn’t get a lot of the
    rigid dogma and deeply negative messages about right and wrong, heaven and
    hell, and sin that so many people receive in their early religious training.
    On the other hand, I had no conscious concept or experience of the spiritual
    dimension of life, and no answers for the questions I had about the meaning
    and purpose of my life.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >My parents really wanted a child, and were very loving to me. Unfortunately
    they were unable to work out their own relationship and were divorced when I
    was two years old. Although I don’t remember it clearly, I know this event
    had a major impact on my life and affected my later patterns in
    relationship. After the divorce, I lived with my mother who never remarried
    or had any other children. My father did remarry, and I often visited my
    father and his other family.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >My mother developed a successful career as a city planner in the days when
    there were few women in that field. She dealt with the usual challenges of
    single parenting — trying to balance the needs of her child with the demands
    of her work. Being the only child of a working mother, I developed a strong
    sense of responsibility and self-sufficiency quite early.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >My mother is a very adventurous person. She loves to try new things, and
    for me, she was a great role model of fearlessness and pioneer spirit. She
    had been one of the first educated American women in her generation to have
    natural childbirth. I was the first baby her doctor had ever delivered
    without an anesthetic. I was blessed with a very fortunate birth. (On
    September 30, 1948, at 9:10 p.m. in Trenton, New Jersey, for all you
    astrologers!)</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >My mother loves to explore new places and we traveled a lot when I was a
    child – &nbsp;all over the United States, to the West Indies, Mexico,
    Hawaii, Europe. We also moved frequently when – &nbsp;ever my mother changed
    jobs. Until I was about fifteen, I had never lived in one place longer than
    two or three years.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >My mother’s family had been Quakers and we still used the “<strong
      >plain language</strong
    >” when speaking to my grandmother (saying “</span
  ><span style="background-color: #e6e64c; color: #000"
    ><strong>thee</strong></span
  ><span style="color: #000"
    >” rather than “<strong>you</strong>” for the Quakers is an acknowledgement
    of the god within each person). So, on a deep level, I absorbed the profound
    respect for spirit and concern for humanity that is woven into the fabric of
    the Quaker religion, which I feel had a strong influence on me later in my
    life.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >When I was fourteen years old I went through an enormous emotional crisis.
    Triggered initially by the collapse of my first romance (with an
    “<strong>older</strong>” man of nineteen — I was sure no one would ever
    compare), it snowballed into a deep and long-lasting existential despair. I
    took a long hard look at life and recognized that there was really no point
    or meaning to it. I could see that all the things that were supposed to
    provide significance in life — education, success, relationships, money —
    were in themselves ephemeral, meaningless, and empty. There didn’t seem to
    be anything else to fill the void. I was deeply disillusioned and depressed,
    and basically remained in that state for several years.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >In retrospect, I can see that I was going through an experience that all of
    us must pass through at one time or another (or many times) — what mystics
    call the piercing of the veil of illusion. It’s the point where we begin to
    recognize that our physical world is not the ultimate reality and we turn
    inward to discover the spiritual aspect of our existence. At these times, we
    usually feel, emotionally, that we are hitting bottom, but as we actually
    hit bottom it’s as if we fall through a trap door into a new place — the
    inner realm of the soul, where we can begin to explore our connection to
    life in a whole new way. When we can face our fears and move through such a
    “<mark class="pen-red"><s>dark night of the soul</s></mark
    ><s>,</s>” we are greeted by the dawn of a profound new adventure.</span

    >New Experiences</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >Over the next few years, I began to have new experiences, openings, a
    growing awareness that did not fit into my former rational framework. In
    college, I studied psychology and got involved in some encounter groups and
    sensitivity training groups that, in addition to allowing me to release old
    emotional pain, led me to new feelings of love, joy, and oneness with all. I
    studied dance and discovered that when I was dancing, I would often have an
    exhilarating feeling, as if some higher force had taken over and was moving
    me in an abandoned and thrilling way.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >I had always been interested in Eastern philosophy, so I read books about
    Buddhism and Hinduism. I practiced yoga and meditation and found that they
    helped me feel more centered, relaxed, and in tune with myself. After
    graduating from college I spent two years traveling around the world, living
    for several months in India, where I gained a deep awareness of the eastern
    mystical tradition. My travels were a powerful experience for me because
    with little money and no real plans, I lived by following my intuition. I
    had set off originally for a vacation in Italy and ended up making a
    two-year journey around the world. I learned that I could live happily with
    virtually no possessions and move safely into unknown places. This was one
    of my earliest experiences of the synergistic things that happen when we
    trust our inner guidance and follow the flow of our energy.</span

    >Getting Conscious</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >When I returned to the United States, I was hooked on something called
    “<mark class="marker-green"><strong>consciousness</strong></mark
    >.” I couldn’t have defined what it was but I knew that I wanted more of it
    and that for me, nothing else mattered as much as my process of personal
    growth. I felt that if I pursued external goals such as career, money, or
    relationships, they would ultimately feel empty, whereas if I devoted myself
    to my own development I would ultimately have the things that my heart
    desired such as loving relationships, meaningful work, and a sense of
    abundance, and that it would all come about in a more satisfying way.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >I was motivated not only by my yearning to find greater fulfillment in my
    own life, but by a strong desire to make a contribution toward positive
    change in the world and in other people’s healing and happiness.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >I moved to the San Francisco Bay area, which I recognized as the forefront
    of the so-called “human potential movement,” and plunged into the earnest
    pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, healing, and transformation. I took classes
    and workshops, avidly read new books, meditated, and talked constantly to
    others involved in the same process. After reading Handbook to Higher
    Consciousness by Ken Keyes, I went to live at his center in Berkeley where
    we worked on our growth intensely, day and night, for a year. After that, I
    continued to live communally for several years with others who were involved
    in an intensive personal development process. During this time, I did
    whatever I could to make enough money to live on — housework, office work,
    odds and ends — while I focused on my real work.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >Since that time, over twenty-five years ago, my life has been dedicated to
    my growth and evolution as a conscious being. I gradually came to understand
    that becoming more conscious meant becoming more aware of all that was
    taking place within me and around me, how my inner world affected my outer
    world and vice versa. I realized that the more <i>awareness</i> I have, the
    more choice I have in how I create or respond to the circumstances of my
    life. When we are relatively unconscious, we simply do what we’ve always
    done, not realizing there is any other way. As we gradually become more
    aware, we begin to recognize that other options exist and we can make other
    choices in how we live.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >At first, I imagined that this process involved a straight line from A to
    B, A being the darkness of ignorance, and B being full “</span
  ><span
    class="text-tiny"
    style="color: #000; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"
    >enlightenment</span
  ><span style="color: #000"
    >.” The goal was to move from A to B as directly as possible. If we were
    dedicated and fortunate enough to achieve enlightenment, we would have
    completed the process; we would be radiant beings, always filled with light,
    love, and wisdom.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >Eventually, I understood that consciousness is an ever unfolding,
    deepening, and expanding process with no end point. We are infinite and
    complex beings, and our human journey involves not just a spiritual
    awakening, but the development of all levels of our being — spiritual,
    mental, emotional, and physical — and the integration of all these aspects
    into a healthy and balanced daily life.</span

    >While in India, I became very fascinated with the Hindu religion and began
    to study it. I had not been raised as a Christian, and that religion had
    never held much interest for me. I liked some of the ideas in Buddhism a
    lot, but it seemed a bit intellectual to me. The myths, symbols, and deities
    in the Hindu religion touched me in a deeper place in my soul. It is a very
    complex religion and I don’t even pretend to understand it, but I grasped a
    few things.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >In the Hindu religion there is a trinity of three main deities that
    symbolize three aspects of life. Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the
    preserver, and Shiva is the destroyer. Shiva represents the constant
    changing of the universe, the fact that everything must constantly be
    destroyed in order to be reborn. He reminds us that we must constantly let
    go of everything we hold on to, in order to flow with the motion of life.
    Many of his fervent devotees give up home and possessions and wander freely,
    abandoning themselves to following and trusting the energy of the universe.
    Shiva is also known as Nataraj — the Lord of the Dance (literally, the Lord
    of Rhythm). They say that it is his dance that keeps the universe in motion.
    He is depicted as a very beautiful and powerful man with long flowing hair.
    (It is said that out of his hair flows the holy Ganges river.) I felt
    irresistibly drawn to him.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >Shakti is the feminine aspect of Shiva. The word “shakti” means “energy” —
    the energy that everything in the universe is made of. It is the energy of
    life — the life force running through our bodies. It also means “female
    energy.” In the Hindu practice of Tantra, there are techniques for
    enlightenment through channeling one’s sexual energy. In this practice, the
    man is referred to as Shiva and the woman as Shakti.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >When I returned from India I met, and for several years lived with, my
    friend Marc Allen. He didn’t think my previous name fit me and, knowing of
    my “love affair” with Shiva, he began calling me Shakti. I liked it and
    began using it. At the time, I don’t think I realized how powerful the name
    was, but I certainly realize it now. I feel that the vibration of the name
    has helped me to emerge into my power.</span

<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >Gawain is the last name I was born with. It is the same name as Sir Gawain
    in the King Arthur legends. According to one dictionary definition, it means
    “battle hawk,” which I think is a wonderful image. To me, Shakti represents
    my feminine aspect, and Gawain, my masculine aspect.</span

<p>

    >I took the course and I was amazed! We started slowly and easily with
    simple techniques that anyone could accept and do, and gradually, we worked
    our way into more unexplainable, but very powerful, processes. After five
    days, I had a strong psychic experience in which, for a period of several
    hours, I was able to consistently pick up specific information that I had no
    way of knowing except through my intuition. That experience began to
    dissolve some of my former limits on what I thought was possible.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >The most important technique I learned in that course was the basic
    technique of creative visualization — relaxing deeply and then picturing a
    desired goal in your mind exactly the way you want it to be. I started to
    practice this technique and found that it was amazingly effective. Quite
    often the things I pictured came true quickly and in unexpected ways. I
    became fascinated with the possibilities and took some other classes and
    workshops on similar subjects. I began to use creative visualization
    techniques in my life regularly and to teach them to my friends. I read The
    Nature of Personal Reality by Jane Roberts and was powerfully affected by
    the idea that we all create our own reality. Soon, I began to lead workshops
    and do private counseling, and eventually wrote Creative Visualization. When
    I got the idea to write the book, I just wanted to gather all the ideas and
    techniques I had learned from various sources and put them down on paper in
    a comprehensive way. I thought I would write a little booklet I could give
    to friends and perhaps sell to my clients and a few interested people. As I
    wrote it, I was filled with self-doubt: “Who am I to be writing a book like
    this? I’m no expert.” Some force inside of me kept pushing me to do it,
    however, so I did. I used creative visualization techniques to help create
    the book. I got an artist friend to design the cover. Then, I hung the cover
    up on my wall and kept imagining and affirming that the book was already
    finished. I found writing it was fairly effortless (except for my nagging
    doubts) and before I knew it, it had turned into a real book that some
    friends and I published together.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >What I didn’t fully realize at the time was that the book was coming from a
    higher creative source within me. On a personality level, I had doubts and
    fears, but because of my inner commitment to myself, I was willing to go
    ahead and follow the creative energy anyhow. Because I had a natural ability
    to think and write clearly, was really interested in these ideas, had a good
    background in the subject, and was willing to take some risks, the universe
    could use me as a creative channel.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    >The publishing process was similar. My friends, Marc Allen and Jon Bernoff,
    and I knew very little about business or publishing, and had no money at
    all, but we had a desire to write and publish our own books. By trusting our
    feelings and being willing to risk acting on them, we found that we were
    led, step by step, in what we needed to do. We made many mistakes in the
    process <i>(mostly when we didn’t follow our inner guidance)</i> and some of
    them were painful and extremely expensive, but, eventually, we created a
    successful publishing company, originally named Whatever Publishing, Inc.,
    now called New World Library.</span

</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #000"
    ><i><strong>Creative Visualization</strong></i> has been successful far
    beyond any wild fantasy I might have had at the time I wrote it. Although it
    was never marketed or publicized in any significant way, other than through
    word of mouth, at the time of this writing it has sold nearly three million
    copies and has been translated into over twenty-five foreign languages.
    Twenty years after its original publication in 1978, the revised edition is
    still selling steadily. Through the years, I have received countless letters
    and calls from people all over the world saying it has helped them transform
    their lives. Of course, this has been quite gratifying to me, especially
    because I can see that it is the higher power of the universe at work. I
    have felt like a proud mother, watching my child out there in the world,
    doing its work and making its fortune, knowing that it is mine and yet not
    mine. It came through me and I helped to form it, and yet it is a being, an
    entity of its own, with its own destiny and its own connection to the
    creative source.</span

    something that happens to you and that all you can do is make the best of

    things outside of myself. Using creative visualization, I began to realize

    wanted it to be. It was very empowering and very freeing.</span

    highest good that they didn’t happen. Other things occurred so miraculously
    that it was as if some unseen force was putting everything in place.
    Sometimes I would have flashes of insight and awareness, or future visions,
    that were highly accurate and seemed to come from a source deep within
    myself. I became more and more interested in discovering what this creative
