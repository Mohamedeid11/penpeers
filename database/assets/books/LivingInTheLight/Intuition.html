<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Part 1</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Intuition</strong></h3>
<p>
  <span class="text-huge"><strong>O</strong></span
  >nce we acknowledge the higher power of the universe, the obvious question
  arises: “How can we contact this power and gain access to it?” After all, if
  there is within us a superior wisdom or a deeper knowledge than we normally
  experience, by tapping into it, we should be able to receive valuable guidance
  in how to live well in this confusing world. This realization began to dawn on
  me many years ago as I undertook my journey of consciousness. I have since
  discovered that the knowingness that resides in each of us can be accessed
  through what we usually call our intuition. By learning to contact, listen to,
  and act on our intuition, we can directly connect to this inner wisdom and
  allow it to become our guiding force.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is where we find ourselves in opposition to life as
  most of us have been taught to live it in the old world. In modern western
  civilization, we have learned to respect and even worship the rational,
  logical aspect of our being, and to dismiss, depreciate, or deny our
  intuition. We do acknowledge the ability of animals to seemingly understand
  things that are way beyond their rational capacity; we call this instinct. But
  it’s a mystery that defies logical explanation, so we shrug our shoulders and
  dismiss it as something vastly inferior to the magnificent human ability to
  reason.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our culture’s entire value system is firmly based
  on the belief that the rational principle is superior and, in fact,
  constitutes the<br />highest truth. The western scientific tradition has
  become our religion. We are taught from a young age to try to be reasonable,
  logical, and consistent, to avoid emotional, irrational behavior, and to
  suppress our feelings. At best, feelings and emotions are considered foolish,
  weak, and bothersome. At worst, we fear they may threaten the very fabric of
  civilized society.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
  Our established religious institutions often support this fear of the
  intuitive, nonrational self. Once based on a deep awareness of the universal
  spiritual principle in every being, many religions only pay lip service to
  that idea now. Instead, they seek to control the behavior of their devotees,
  using elaborate rule structures purported to save people from their deep,
  irrational, and basically “sinful” natures. And according to many
  psychological disciplines, the dark and dangerous instinctual nature of man
  must be controlled. From this perspective, it is only the rational part of us
  that is capable of harnessing this mysterious force and channeling it into
  healthy, constructive modes.
</p>
<p>
  In our worship of the rational and fear of the nonrational, we deny not only
  our emotions and our instinctual energies such as sexuality and aggression,
  but also our natural intuitive sense, which is meant to be a primary guiding
  force in our lives.
</p>
<p>
  Generally, less technically developed societies approach life with a deep
  awareness of, and respect for, the intuitive element of existence. Every
  moment of their daily lives is guided by a strong sense of connection with the
  creative force. However, it is their very lack of technical development that
  has contributed to their gradual destruction or subversion by modern
  civilization. Two examples relevant to most Americans are the Native American
  and African cultures. Both of these groups were devastated by their contact
  with European/American culture. However, a deep curiosity, respect, and
  appreciation for Native Americans has begun to surface in our awareness in
  recent years. And the African culture, forcibly brought to this continent, has
  probably done more than any other culture to keep the intuitive power alive in
  our country through its strong and soulful connection to spirit.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">
  In human evolution, it seems that as our rational capacity has evolved, we’ve
  grown increasingly fearful of the other aspects of our natures. We’ve
  attempted to control these “dark forces” by creating authoritative rule
  structures that define right and wrong, good and bad, and appropriate and
  inappropriate behavior in a very heavy-handed way. We justify this rigid
  approach to life by blaming everything on nonrational nature — from our
  personal emotional dramas to social ills such as drug and alcohol
  addiction,crime, violence, and war.
</p>
<p>
  The truth is that all aspects of our being are integral, important, and
  valuable parts of us. The more we distrust and suppress these energies, the
  more likely they are to eventually burst out in distorted ways. In other
  words, our problems are not necessarily caused by our emotional, nonrational
  nature running wild and uncontrolled; instead, both personal and social
  problems are more likely to be the result of fear and the suppression of our
  emotions, instinctual nature, and intuition. In this book, we are focusing on
  how we can reclaim the power of our intuitive sense.
</p>
<p>
  Once we accept the reality of a higher power that is channeled to us through
  our intuition, it becomes clear that many of our personal problems and the
  ills of the world are actually caused by not following our intuition.
</p>
<p>
  Our rational mind is like a computer — it processes the input it receives and
  calculates logical conclusions based on this information. The rational mind is
  finite; it can only compute the input it has received directly. In other
  words, our rational minds can only operate on the basis of the direct
  experience each of us has had in this lifetime.
</p>
<p>
  The intuitive mind, on the other hand, seems to have access to an infinite
  supply of information. It appears to be able to tap into<br />a deep
  storehouse of knowledge and wisdom — the universal mind. It is also able to
  sort out this information and supply us with exactly what we need, when we
  need it. Though the message may come through a bit at a time, if we learn to
  follow this supply of information piece by piece, the necessary course of
  action will be revealed. As we learn to rely on this guidance, life takes on a
  flowing, effortless quality. Our life, feelings, and actions interweave
  harmoniously with those of others around us.
</p>
<p>
  It is as if each of us played a unique instrument in a huge symphony
  orchestra, conducted by a universal intelligence. If we play our part without
  regard for the conductor’s direction or the rest of the orchestra, we will
  have total chaos. If we try to take our cues from those around us, rather than
  the conductor, it will be impossible to achieve harmony — there are too many
  people, all playing different things. Our intellect is not able to process so
  much input and decide on the best note to play at each moment. However, if we
  watch the conductor and follow his direction we can experience the joy of
  playing our unique part, which can be heard and appreciated by everyone, and
  at the same time experience ourselves as part of a greater harmonious whole.
</p>
<p>
  When we apply this analogy to our lives, we see that most of us have never
  realized a conductor was present. We have lived the best we can, using only
  our intellect to understand our lives, to figure out the best course of
  action. If we are honest with ourselves, we will readily admit that we are not
  making great music under the guidance of our rational mind alone. The
  dissonance and chaos in our lives and in the world certainly reflects the
  impossibility of living this way.
</p>
<p>
  By tuning into the intuition and allowing it to become the guiding force in
  our lives, we allow our inner “conductor” to take its rightful place as the
  leader of the orchestra. Rather than losing our individual freedom, we receive
  the support we need to effectively express our individuality. Moreover, we
  will enjoy the experience of being part of a larger creative process.<br />I
  don’t fully understand how the intuition functions in such an amazing way, but
  I definitely know, through direct experience and through observation and
  feedback from the many people I have worked with, that it does. And I find
  that the more I trust and follow this inner intuitive “voice,” the easier,
  fuller, and more exciting my life becomes.

</h4>
<p>
  Sit or lie down in a comfortable position in a quiet place. Close your eyes
  and relax. Take several slow, deep breaths, relaxing your body more with each
  breath. Relax your mind and let your thoughts drift, but don’t hold onto any
  thought. Imagine that your mind becomes as quiet as a peaceful lake.
</p>
<p>
  Now focus your conscious awareness into a deep place in your body, in the area
  of your stomach or solar plexus. It should be the place in your body where you
  feel that your “gut feelings” reside. This is the physical place where you can
  easily contact your intuition.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine that you have a wise being living inside there. You might have an
  image of what this wise being looks like, or you might just sense that it is
  there. This wise being is really a part of you — your intuitive self. You can
  communicate with it by silently “talking” to it, making requests, or asking
  questions. Then relax, don’t think too hard with your rational mind, and be
  open to receiving the answers. The answers are usually very simple, they
  relate to the present moment (not the past or future), and they feel right .
</p>
<p>
  If you don’t receive an immediate answer, let go and go about your life. The
  answer will come later, whether from inside of you in the form of a feeling or
  idea, or from outside through a person, a book, an event, or whatever.
</p>
<p>For example, you might say,&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i
      ><strong
        >“Intuition, tell me what I need to know here. What do I need to do in
        this situation?”</strong

  you get and act on it. If it is truly your intuition, you will find that it
  leads to a feeling of greater aliveness and power, and more opportunities
  begin to open up for you. If it doesn’t lead to these things, you may not have
  been truly acting from your intuition but from some other voice in you. Go
  back and ask for clarification.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  It takes practice to hear and trust your intuition. The more you do it, the
  easier it will become. Eventually you will be able to contact your intuition,
  ask yourself questions, and know that in that wise being within you, an
  incredible source of power and strength is available to answer your questions
  and guide you. As you grow more sensitive to this guidance you will gain a
  sense of knowing what you need to do in any situation. Your intuitive power is
  always available to guide you whenever you need it. It will open to you as you
  become willing to trust yourself and your inner knowledge.

<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Part 2</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Becoming a Creative Channel</strong></h3>
<p>
  <span class="text-huge"><strong>T</strong></span
  >o whatever degree you listen to and follow your intuition, you become a
  “creative channel” for the higher power of the universe. When you willingly
  follow where your creative energy leads, the higher power can come through you
  to manifest its creative work.<br />When this happens, you will find yourself
  flowing with the energy, doing what you really want to do, and feeling the
  power of the universe moving through you to create or transform everything
  around you.
</p>
<p>
  In using the word channel, I am not referring to the psychic process of trance
  channeling. Trance channeling involves a medium who goes into a trance state
  and allows another being to speak through him or her. By channeling, I mean
  being in touch with and<br />bringing through the wisdom and creativity of
  your own deepest source. Being a channel is being fully and freely yourself
  and consciously knowing that you are a vehicle for the creativity of the
  universe.
</p>
<p>
  Every creative genius has been a channel. Every masterwork has been created
  through the channeling process. Great works are not<br />created by the
  personality alone. They arise from a deep inspiration on the universal level,
  and are then expressed and brought into form through the individual
  personality.

<p>
  A person may have great technical skill, but without the ability to connect
  with a deeper source, his work will be uninspiring. The difference between a
  technician and a channel was clearly demonstrated in the movie Amadeus. The
  composer Salieri knew how to write music but he didn’t know how to tap into
  the creative source. Mozart wrote music that was both technically perfect and
  wonderfully inspired, and he did so easily, spontaneously, without thought or
  effort. From his early childhood on, music just seemed to bubble up and
  overflow from within him. I’m sure he had no idea how it happened and could
  not have explained to anyone else<br />how to do it.
</p>
<p>
  Such genius has always seemed mysterious and unexplainable, a God-given talent
  possessed by only a few. It seems to come and go at will — sometimes it’s
  there, sometimes it’s not. Because of this, many creative people fear their
  talent will suddenly disappear. They don’t know how they got it so they have
  no idea how to recover it if it vanishes.
</p>
<p>
  Creative people often function as channels in only one area of their lives
  (such as one of the arts, science, or business) and may have no idea how to do
  it in other areas of their lives. Thus, their lives can be terribly out of
  balance. (See the section on Highly Intuitive People in the chapter on
  Trusting Intuition.) This is one reason why we often equate genius with
  emotional instability.
</p>
<p>
  I believe we are all geniuses — each in our own unique way. We will discover
  the nature of our particular genius when we stop trying to conform to our own
  or other people’s models, learn to be ourselves, and allow our natural channel
  to open. Through trusting and acting on our intuition, it’s possible to bring
  our natural creative inspiration into every moment, in every area of our
  lives.
</p>
<p>
  When I speak of a channel, I have an image of a long round pipe with energy
  flowing through it. It’s somewhat like the pipe in a pipe organ, with the
  music coming through.
</p>
<p>This channel image has three important features:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    It is open and unobstructed inside so that the energy can move through
    freely.
  </li>
  <li>
    It has a definite physical form; a structure surrounds the open space so
    that the energy is directed in a particular way.Without this structure, the
    energy would be free-floating, without any focus.
  </li>
  <li>
    It has a power source — something that moves energy through the channel.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  In a pipe organ, the power source (the organ) sends energy through the open
  pipes. The particular combination of open space inside each pipe and the
  structure — the size and shape of the pipe — causes a certain note to be
  sounded. The power source is the same for all the pipes and the energy moving
  through them is the same, but because each one is a different shape, each one
  makes a unique sound.
</p>
<p>
  We can think of ourselves as channels similar to these pipes. We have a common
  power source (the universal life force) and the same creative energy flows
  through each of us. Our body and personality form the structure that
  determines the unique direction and function of each of us as a channel. It is
  up to us to keep our channel open and clear and to build and maintain a
  strong, healthy, beautiful body/personality structure as a vehicle for our
  creative energy. We can do this by constantly tuning in, asking where the
  energy wants to go, and moving with it.
</p>
<p>
  A strong body/personality structure is not created by following anybody else’s
  rules or good ideas about what you should eat, how you should exercise, or
  anything else. It is created primarily by trusting your intuition and learning
  to follow its direction . When deciding what to eat, how to exercise, or
  anything else, gather information from reliable sources, then check in with
  yourself to see what feels intuitively right for you, and do your best to
  follow your own inner guidance.
</p>
<p>
  Most of us have had occasional experiences of trusting our intuition and
  having things work out in amazing ways. The following true story is a good
  example of this. A few years ago, my editor, Becky, had achieved what many
  people think of as the “American dream.” She had a husband and daughter, a
  good job, money in the bank, and owned her own home. Yet she felt an emptiness
  inside.
</p>
<p>
  She felt an inner prompting to leave her job and pursue a career in
  publishing. Her husband did not support this idea. In fact, he pointed out
  that she didn’t have the “formal education necessary” to obtain a position in
  a publishing house.
</p>
<p>
  Becky and her husband eventually separated, and she decided to make a move.
  She had been reading many books, including <i>Living in the Light</i>, and
  knew that she wanted to work for a publisher in the field of personal growth.
  Her intuitive feeling was that she needed to move to Northern California.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  It was the most difficult and couragious step she had ever taken. She found
  herself in a new community with no friends, no job, and no money.<img

  She had no luck, at first, obtaining a publishing job, and so she looked for
  any kind of work that would enable her to survive. Many times she questioned
  her choice to take such a risk, yet she kept feeling a deep sense that she was
  on the right track.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, she found work in another field. She was able to get back on her feet
  financially and she regained her confidence. She continued her search for a
  publishing job, and this time she was successful. She happily took a cut in
  pay and position to take an entry-level job at New World Library — the company
  she had always hoped to work for. Finally, she felt, she was at home. As of
  this writing, Becky has been with New World Library for six years.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>She has her dream job as the editorial director.</p>
<p>
  By following her inner guidance, even through very difficult times, she found
  the perfect place to express her creativity and make her contribution to the
  world.

  You may have had a similar experience, where listening to your intuition about
  something proved so fruitful and fulfilling. If so, the next step is to become
  more conscious of the process so you can recognize when you are following the
  flow of energy, as opposed to blocking, fighting, or trying to control it. The
  more willing you are to surrender to the energy within you, the more power can
  flow through you.
</p>
<p>
  I know most of us have had experiences at certain times when we’ve felt life
  energy, wisdom, and power flow through us, when we have felt momentarily
  “enlightened.” We have a brief moment of clarity and power and then it goes
  away again. When it goes away, we feel lost and unsure of ourselves.
</p>
<p>
  The more you practice trusting and following your intuition, the more
  consistently you will feel that sense of “flow.” At these times you may find
  yourself right where you want to be at every moment. You’ll be where the
  energy is the greatest for you, doing what you want to do, and watching
  miracles being accomplished.<br />Your energy may have a transformational
  effect on others, as well.
</p>
<p>
  As you strengthen the commitment to trusting yourself, everything in your life
  may change. At first, as you begin to let go of your old patterns, it may
  appear that things in your life are falling apart. You may find that you have
  to let go of certain things you’ve been attached to. Some relationships in
  your life may dissolve or simply “fizzle out” from lack of energy. Old
  pastimes may no longer interest you. You may even lose your job or decide to
  leave it.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, these changes can be upsetting and frightening. Over time, however,
  you will find that this is all part of the transformation you are going
  through. As you learn to be true to yourself, you will find that you attract
  people, work, and other circumstances that reflect your evolution and
  development.

    >Maintaining Your Focus</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  In order to live fully and creatively, it’s important to stay focused on
  following your own energy. This focus allows your channel to remain open to
  the energy flowing through. It’s so easy to lose your focus, to get lost in
  other people, external goals, and desires. And the problem is, we do exactly
  that: we lose our connection with ourselves. As long as we are overly focused
  on the outside there will always be an empty, hungry, lost place inside that
  needs to be filled.
</p>
<p>
  If I’m in love with someone and begin to think of him as my source of joy,
  then I lose myself. I have to remind myself that the source of joy and love is
  already within me, that I am experiencing love externally only because it is
  inside me. I try to keep the focus on the universe within and at the same time
  feel the universe coming through my lover to me.
</p>
<p>
  For me, it’s a constant discipline to remember to go back inside to connect
  with my intuition. I’ll remind myself regularly during the day to do this. If
  I find myself getting lost in my outer activities, I’ll check back inside to
  see if I’m being true to my feelings. This keeps the flow of the universe
  moving through me.
</p>
<p>
  As we learn to pay attention to our intuitive feelings, follow our own energy
  and live our truth, we find that we feel more and more of the life force
  moving through us. That feeling of greater aliveness is so wonderful that it
  becomes our major focus and source of fulfillment.
</p>
<p>
  We feel less attached to the externals of our lives. Whether or not things go
  as we have planned seems less important when we feel that our satisfaction is
  coming primarily from sustaining our connection to our own life energy.
  Ironically, when we stay true to ourselves in this way, the externals of our
  lives reflect our inner integrity. We attract to us and create around us
  exactly what our hearts and souls truly desire.

    >Living as a Channel</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  Channeling works in two ways: energy either flows through you to others, or
  from others to you. For example, as I write my book, I focus on the energy
  flowing from the universe through me to others. Then, when people say to me,
  “I just love your books; they’ve changed my life,” I am conscious of
  appreciation coming from them to me, and through me, back to the universal
  source.
</p>
<p>
  As you become increasingly conscious of the flow of life moving through you
  and through everything and everyone else, your body will become capable of
  channeling more energy. The more energy you are willing to receive, the more
  you’ll be able to give.
</p>
<p>
  To become a clear channel for the universe presents the highest challenge and
  offers the greatest potential joy and fulfillment for every human being. Being
  a channel means living fully and passionately in the world, having deep
  relationships, playing, working, creating, enjoying money and material
  possessions, being yourself, yet maintaining your profound connection with the
  power of the universe within you, learning and growing from every experience
  that you have.
</p>
<p>
  Then you can watch the universe create through you; it can use you to do its
  work. Living as a channel is an ongoing learning process that’s available to
  anyone who is willing to make the inner commitment.
</p>

    >Group Channeling</span

</h4>
<p>
  As we develop the ability to trust and follow our intuition, we learn to open
  and strengthen our individual channel so we can bring more power, creativity,
  and love through us. When we come together in a relationship or in a group,
  each individual channel becomes part of a bigger channel. A group channel is
  created that is more powerful than any of us can be individually.<br />When
  many bodies and minds are willing to surrender, open up, and grow, these
  combined energies create a very strong, open structure that allows a lot more
  energy to come through from the universe. The process intensifies tremendously
  and everyone gets a powerful “boost” from the energy, which is capable of
  pushing each of us to the next level of our growth. Even though we may all<br />be
  in somewhat different places and going through different things, each person
  receives the inspiration, the support, the push, or whatever is needed to
  enable them to take the next step on their journey. A group channel can open
  us up to a deeper level of awareness, and in the process, we share more of
  ourselves and find that we are healed of things that have held us back.
</p>
<p>
  This is one reason I love teaching workshops and working with groups. My
  friends call me an “energy junkie” because I’m always attracted to situations
  where the energy is most intense and expansive. I love the way my personal
  growth process is accelerated by the intensification that happens in groups.
</p>
<p>
  I have found that in leading a group, I usually need to start with a certain
  amount of structure and take responsibility to clearly maintain the leader
  position. As the group continues, I can let go of the structure more and more
  and gradually allow the spontaneous energy of the group to take over.
</p>
<p>
  As everyone surrenders and opens up, the group channel is formed. This process
  can be confusing and chaotic at times because, as the leader, I am no longer
  “in control” in the usual sense of the word. It can arouse my fears and
  everyone else’s, but I find that when I’m willing to move through the fears,
  something powerful and beautiful emerges through the group channel. The
  universe leads us into new places and new discoveries that we would not have
  had an opportunity to experience if we had stayed within a more formal
  structure. I find the process of group channeling very exciting and rewarding.
</p>
<p>
  In a sense, everyone living on this planet is a part of a gigantic group
  channel — the mass consciousness of humanity. This world, as it is now, is the
  creation of the group channel. As each one of us, individually, surrenders to
  the power of the universe and allows that power to transform and enlighten us,
  the group channel is affected accordingly. The mass consciousness becomes more
  and more evolved. This is how I see our world being transformed.

</h4>
<p>
  Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath
  and relax your body. Take another deep breath and relax your mind. Continue to
  breathe slowly and deeply and let go of all tension or anxiety. As you relax,
  you find yourself in a deep, quiet place inside. Allow yourself to just rest
  in that place for a few moments, with nothing you need to do or think about.
</p>
<p>
  From this deep, quiet place, begin to sense the life force within you. Imagine
  that you are following your own energy, feeling it, trusting it, moving with
  it in every moment of your life. You are being completely true to yourself,
  speaking and living your truth. You feel alive and empowered. Imagine that you
  are expressing your creativity fully and freely, and let yourself enjoy that
  experience. By being who you are and expressing yourself, you are having a
  healing and empowering effect on everyone you encounter and on the world
  around you.
