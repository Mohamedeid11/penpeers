<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Part 1</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Exploring Our Many Selves</strong></h3>
<p>
  We are all born with an infinite number of different qualities or energies
  within us. One of our most important tasks in life is to discover and develop
  as many of these energies as possible, so that we can be well-rounded, and
  experience the full range of our<br />potential.
</p>
<p>
  We can think of these energies as different archetypes, sub personalities, or
  selves within us. In a way, it’s as if there are many different characters
  living inside of us, each with its own task and purpose.
</p>
<p>
  Since the physical world is a plane of duality, for each of these energies
  within us, there is an opposite energy. In order to experience wholeness and
  balance, we need to develop and integrate both sides of every polarity.
</p>
<p>
  Most of us, however, are not accustomed to thinking in this way. We have been
  taught to think in a linear, exclusive fashion – good/bad, right/wrong. So if
  one quality is good or desirable, its opposite is bad, or undesirable.
</p>
<p>
  For example, many of us have been taught that it is virtuous and admirable to
  give to others; a person who gives a lot is a good person. Therefore, taking
  is thought to be selfish; a person who takes a lot for himself might be judged
  as less worthy than a giving person.
</p>
<p>
  Someone else with different values might think of this in an opposite way. He
  might admire a person who knows how to take a lot for himself and think of
  that person as smart and successful, while looking down on someone who is less
  aggressive and more giving as being foolish and easily taken advantage of.
</p>
<p>
  Either way, one polarity is honored while the opposite is devalued. In
  reality, both giving and receiving are equally important and valuable. If we
  give too much and aren’t able to take or receive equally, we become depleted
  and resentful. If we take too much and are unable to give, we lose the
  satisfaction of making a contribution, and incur the resentment of others. If
  we can give and receive more or less in balance, we experience a healthy sense
  of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
  From the time we are born, we begin to experiment with expressing the
  different energies within us. At that time we are completely dependent on our
  parents or caretakers for our survival and well-being, so we are extremely
  sensitive to their reactions to us. If we express an energy that invokes
  approval and positive attention, we are likely to continue to develop that
  quality. On the other hand, if something we do draws disapproval, criticism,
  or punishment, we are likely to discontinue it (unless that is the only form
  of attention we can get, in which case we may continue it).
</p>
<p>
  Fairly soon, we have a pretty good sense of which energies help us get our
  needs met and which ones seem to cause us more problems than they are worth.
  This varies greatly according to each individual, family system, time period,
  and culture.
</p>
<p>
  As we grow up, we continue to develop the energies that seem to work best to
  meet our needs. We become very identified with these qualities; that’s who we
  think we are. These dominant energies become our primary selves — the inner
  characters whose job it is to take care of us and make our lives work as well
  as possible.
</p>
<p>
  There are usually a group of primary selves who work together as a team,
  making most of our decisions for us. For example, some of my primary selves
  are the super-responsible one, the pleaser
  <strong>(who wants to make everyone happy so they will like me)</strong>, the
  pusher (who wants me to work hard and accomplish a lot), the caretaking mother
  <strong
    >(who takes care of the child in other people so that they’ll feel good with
    me)</strong
  >, the consciousness teacher/healer. There are a number of others on the team
  as well. They have all worked very hard to make me a worthy, well-loved, and
  successful person.
</p>
<p>
  For every primary self, there is an opposite energy, which oftentimes has been
  repressed or denied because one way or another we got the message that it was
  not okay, or because it simply hasn’t had space to develop. These energies
  become our disowned selves. They are usually buried within our psyche and we
  either don’t know about them at all, or we are aware of them and try to hide
  them from the world. The disowned selves make up our shadow side, the parts of
  ourselves that we are embarrassed about, ashamed of, fearful of, or
  uncomfortable with. Our primary selves are usually working hard to make sure
  that we don’t show these disowned selves to the world, since they are
  convinced that this would invite criticism, rejection, abandonment, or some
  form of disaster.
</p>
<p>
  The problem is that each of these disowned selves carries an essential energy
  that is an important part of us. In fact, we are often in desperate need of
  these qualities in order to bring healing and balance into our lives. As long
  as we fear our shadow side, however, we can’t access the energies that we
  need.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if one of your primary selves is power, and you are very
  identified with being strong, competent, and independent, it is very likely
  that you have disowned your vulnerable side, the part of you that feels
  dependent on others and has needs for love and support. From the point of view
  of your power primary self, your vulnerable side might seem disgusting, and
  way too dangerous to show to the world for fear of being hurt. You might be
  completely unconscious of having a vulnerable side, or you might be aware of
  it but not want others to see it for fear of their judgment. Strangely, you
  will find that you are constantly attracting vulnerable people into your life,
  and you may at times feel very judgmental toward them for being so “weak.”
</p>
<p>
  Believe it or not, you need to consciously accept and “own” your vulnerable
  side. Without it, you cannot have real intimacy and closeness with others, and
  you can’t really receive. You are out of touch with a very important part of
  your human experience.
</p>
<p>
  Life has an amazing way of confronting us with, and reflecting to us, the
  exact energies that we need to discover within ourselves and integrate into
  our lives. This happens through our dreams, where we are often shown
  symbolically the relationships between our primary selves and disowned selves.
  It happens constantly in our relationships, where others reflect to us the
  various different selves within us. Our imbalances show up in every area of
  our lives from our health to our finances.
</p>
<p>
  How do we become conscious of the many selves within and bring them into
  balance in our lives?
</p>
<p>
  The first and most important step is to begin to recognize and become aware of
  our primary selves. What qualities and energies are you most identified with?
  Can you begin to notice the selves within you that automatically make most of
  your decisions and run your life?
</p>
<p>
  We want to honor and appreciate our primary selves for how much they’ve done
  for us, while separating a bit from being totally identified with them. As
  soon as we become conscious of them as energies within us rather than who we
  are, we are beginning to develop what is called “aware ego.”* Aware ego is the
  ability to recognize and hold all the different selves within us, so that we
  can have conscious choice about which ones we bring through at any given
  moment.
</p>
<p>
  Once we have some awareness in relation to our primary selves, the disowned
  selves start to come forth. The primary selves usually remain our strongest
  qualities, but we begin to feel more balanced and our lives begin to work
  better as we begin to integrate the energy from previously disowned selves.
  The disidentification with the primary selves, the development of aware ego,
  and the acknowledging of the disowned selves is a gradual process that happens
  over a lifetime. Every step we take in this process, however, can make a big
  difference in our lives.
</p>
<p>
  Our intuitive wisdom is one of the energies or selves within us. If we were
  encouraged to trust our intuition at an early age, or had an intuitive parent
  figure as an early role model, our intuition may be a primary self. Since our
  culture tends to deny or devalue the intuitive function, however, for must of
  us it is a disowned or relatively underdeveloped self, while rationality is
  usually one of the primary selves.
</p>
<p>
  If rationality is a primary self, and intuition is disowned, in order to get
  in touch with our inner guidance, we may need to separate from
  over-identification with our rational side. We do this by recognizing it as
  one aspect of who we are, and beginning to notice how it operates in our
  lives. Once we become more aware of it in this way, we are no longer so
  identified with it and we can begin to have more conscious choice about how
  and when we use it. This creates space to explore our intuitive side as well.
</p>
<p>
  If intuition is a primary self, we may have difficulty thinking logically or
  dealing with practical matters in a grounded way. In this case, we may need to
  develop our rational, practical side in order to ground our intuition in the
  physical world.

    >Owning Our Shadow Side</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  There is a simple universal principle: Everything in the universe wants to be
  accepted. All aspects of creation want to be loved,<br />appreciated, and
  included. So, any quality or energy that you are not allowing yourself to
  experience or express will keep coming up inside of you or around you until
  you recognize it as a part of you, until you accept it and integrate it into
  your personality and your life.
</p>
<p>
  Many people who are involved in personal growth become very identified with
  the energies and qualities that they think of as being “spiritual” — peaceful,
  loving, giving, and so on. In attempting to develop these aspects of
  themselves, they often deny and disown other aspects that they consider to be
  “unspiritual” — aggression, assertiveness, gut-level honesty, human
  vulnerability. Unfortunately, this simply creates a huge shadow side within
  them, which contributes to the collective shadow of denied energies in our
  world.
</p>
<p>
  For some, it can be quite shocking to realize that if we overidentify with
  peace and love, and disown our inner warrior, we are<br />not contributing to
  world peace. Quite the opposite, in fact. If we don’t own our inner warrior
  and channel him in a constructive way in our lives, he retreats into the
  shadows of our individual and collective psyche, and actually contributes to
  the perpetuation of war on our planet.
</p>
<p>
  If we truly want inner peace and world peace, we must do the difficult but
  fascinating work of owning and appreciating all aspects of who we are — truly
  making peace with ourselves. Real consciousness involves holding both sides of
  any polarity, not identifying with one. Exploring and embracing our darkness
  is the only way we can truly live in the light.

</h4>
<p>
  Get in a comforable position in a quiet place. Bring to mind one of your main
  personality characteristics or primary selves. Get a sense in your body of how
  that energy feels. Now imagine an opposite energy, which may be disowned or
  less developed in you. Imagine what that energy would feel like. What would be
  the positive benefits of developing more ability to contact that energy? How
  could that bring more balance into your life?
</p>
<p>
  See if you can feel a balance of both of those energies at the same time. For
  example, if you are an outgoing person, you might balance that with a quieter,
  more introspective energy. If you are hardworking, you might balance that with
  the energy of relaxation or playfulness.

<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Part 2</strong></h2>
<h4 style="text-align: center"><strong>The World as Our Mirror</strong></h4>
<p>
  The physical world is our creation: we each create our own version of the
  world, our particular reality, our unique life experience. Because I am
  creating my life, I can look at my creation to get feedback about myself. Just
  as an artist looks at his latest creation to see what works well and what
  doesn’t, and thereby improves his skills, we can look at the ongoing
  masterwork of our lives to appreciate who we are and to recognize what we
  still need to learn.
</p>
<p>
  We’re creating our lives as we go along; therefore, our experiences give us an
  instant, ongoing reflection of ourselves. In fact, the external world is like
  a giant mirror that reflects our consciousness clearly and accurately. Once we
  have learned how to look into that mirror and perceive and interpret its
  reflection, we have a fabulous tool for self-awareness.
</p>
<p>
  Understanding that the world is our mirror can help us see our lives as a
  reflection of our beliefs, attitudes, and emotional patterns. Viewed in this
  way, the external world can teach us about hidden aspects of ourselves that we
  can’t see directly. The process is based on two premises:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    I assume that everything in my life is my reflection, my creation; there are
    no accidents or events that are unrelated to me. If I see or feel something,
    if it has any impact on me, then my soul has attracted or created it to show
    me something. If it didn’t mirror some part of myself, I wouldn’t even be
    able to see it. All the people in my life are reflections of the various
    characters and energies that live inside of me.
  </li>
  <li>
    I always try to avoid putting myself down for the reflections I see. I know
    that nothing is negative. Everything is a gift that brings me to
    self-awareness — after all, I’m here to learn. If I was already perfect I
    wouldn’t be here. Why should I get angry at myself when I see things I’ve
    been unconscious of ? It would be like a first grader getting frustrated
    because she wasn’t in college yet. I try to maintain a compassionate
    attitude toward myself and my learning process. To the extent that I can do
    this, the learning process becomes fun and really quite interesting.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  I am learning to view my life as a fascinating and adventurous movie. All the
  characters in it are parts of me played out on the big screen so that I can
  clearly see them. Once I see them and recognize their various feelings and
  voices inside myself, I can understand that they are all important and
  valuable parts of me that I need for my full expression in this life.
</p>
<p>
  If the movie portrays problems, hassles, or struggles, I know I must check
  inside to find out where I’m not being true to myself or have more learning
  and healing to do. I also know that when I’m trusting and being myself as
  fully as possible, everything in my life reflects this by falling into place
  easily and working smoothly.
</p>

    >Problems Are Messages</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  If there are problems in your life, the universe is trying to get your
  attention. It’s saying, “Hey, there’s something you need to be aware of,
  something that needs to be changed here!” If you pay attention to the small
  signals, you will learn from them, but if you don’t, the problems will
  intensify until you get the message and start to pay attention. If you accept
  that every time a problem occurs the universe is showing you something, you
  will make rapid progress on your journey of self-discovery.
</p>
<p>
  When something “negative” happens, it’s tempting to say, “Why does this happen
  to me? I’m doing the best I can but nothing seems to be going right. I can’t
  understand why I keep having this problem.” If you find yourself doing this,
  try to open up to another way of looking at things. Go inside and say to the
  universe, “I know you’re trying to show me something. Help me understand what
  it is.”
</p>
<p>
  After you do this, let go of focusing on it, and go about your life, but stay
  open to the message that will be coming through. It<br />may come in the form
  of an inner feeling or awareness, some words from a friend, or something
  unexpected that happens to you. The message may come through immediately or it
  may take quite a while. One of my clients was fired, quite unexpectedly, over
  two years ago. At first, he was devastated, but after a few months of “getting
  his bearings,” he went into business on his own. His business is now doing
  very well, but it was only a few weeks ago that he understood the message that
  his firing reflected. As he was talking to a friend about working for other
  people, he suddenly realized that the firing incident was trying to tell him
  that he was ready to be in business for himself, rather than working for other
  people. For him, this realization not only affirmed his present course in
  life, but it also finally resolved the sense of failure about being fired that
  had lingered with him since the incident.
</p>

    >Interpreting the Reflection</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  The trickiest part of using the mirror process is learning how to interpret
  the reflection you see. Once you do get a message, but you’re not quite sure
  what it is, how do you find out?
</p>
<p>
  It will not help to over-analyze or obsess about it with your rational mind.
  It is far more effective to turn to your intuitive self, to ask the universe
  for help. Simply sit quietly, take a few deep breaths, and focus your
  awareness within — to the wise part of you that is in touch with the wisdom of
  the universe. Ask this part, either silently or out loud, for guidance or help
  in understanding the message. As you tune into your gut feelings and get a
  sense of what feels right in the moment, act on this feeling.
</p>
<p>
  After acting on the feeling, try to be aware of the external and internal
  feedback from your actions. The external feedback is how well things work. Do
  things seem to fall into place and work easily? Then you’re surely in tune
  with your inner guidance. If you’re struggling to do something that doesn’t
  happen easily, it’s a message to let go and check back in to find out what you
  really want to be doing.
</p>
<p>
  Internal feedback will come to you as feelings. If you feel empowered, more
  alive, then it’s right. The ultimate key is aliveness. The more the universe
  moves through you, the more alive you feel. Conversely, every time you don’t
  follow your inner guidance you feel a loss of energy, loss of power, a sense
  of spiritual or emotional deadness.
</p>
<p>
  In being true to yourself you will feel more alive, but you may also feel
  uncomfortable. This is because you are risking change! As you undergo certain
  changes, you may experience various intense emotions such as fear, grief, or
  anger. Allow these emotions expression; after all, your inner guidance has to
  move through years of accumulated unconsciousness, denial, doubt, and fear. So
  let your feelings come up and wash through you — you are being cleaned out and
  healed.
</p>
<p>
  At times like this, it is very important to have emotional support and a safe
  place to explore your feelings and do your healing process. If possible, I
  recommend finding a good therapist or support group — an environment where you
  are encouraged and supported in experiencing your own feelings and needs,
  expressing yourself honestly, and trusting your own sense of what’s right for
  you.
</p>
<p>
  When you are growing and changing rapidly, your inner doubts and fears will
  often be reflected in the reactions of those around you. If your friends and
  family question or judge the changes in you, recognize that they are simply
  mirroring the doubting, fearful voices in you, such as, “What if I’m doing the
  wrong thing? Can I really trust this process?”
</p>
<p>
  Respond to such feedback from others in whatever way you feel is appropriate:
  reassure them, ignore them, argue with them,<br />whatever. The important
  thing is to recognize that you are really dealing with your own inner fears.
  The conflicts you may experience with others are mirroring the conflicts
  within yourself, between the parts of you that want to grow and change, and
  those that feel safer to do things the way you’ve always done them. Affirm
  that you are learning to trust yourself more and more. You will be amazed to
  see how frequently others will begin to mirror your increasing self-trust and
  confidence by responding to you with trust and confidence.
</p>
<p>Here are some ways that the mirror of life reflects us:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
  <li>
    If you judge and criticize yourself, others will judge and criticize you.
  </li>
  <li>If you hurt yourself, others will hurt you.</li>
  <li>If you lie to yourself, others will lie to you.</li>
  <li>
    If you are irresponsible to yourself, others will be irresponsible in
    relation to you.
  </li>
  <li>If you blame yourself, others will blame you.</li>
  <li>
    If you do violence to yourself emotionally, others will do violence to you
    emotionally, or even physically.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you don’t listen to your feelings, no one will listen to your feelings.
  </li>
  <li>If you love yourself, others will love you.</li>
  <li>If you respect yourself, others will respect you.</li>
  <li>If you trust yourself, others will trust you.</li>
  <li>If you are honest with yourself, others will be honest with you.</li>
  <li>
    If you are gentle and compassionate with yourself, others will treat you
    with compassion.
  </li>
  <li>If you appreciate yourself, others will appreciate you.</li>
  <li>If you honor yourself, others will honor you.</li>
  <li>If you enjoy yourself, others will enjoy you.</li>

    >Changing Old Patterns</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  It’s very important to realize &nbsp;عندما يريد العالم أن
  <span style="color: crimson">يتكلّم</span> that you may not be able to change
  your old patterns overnight. Sometimes things seem to change rapidly, once
  you’ve recognized the message, but sometimes it seems like you keep doing the
  same thing and getting the same unpleasant results long after you feel you
  know better. It takes time for the personality to change its habits, so you
  may have to watch the same old movie repeat itself a few more times.
</p>
<p>
  If you feel your progress is too slow, ask the universe for help, and reach
  out for human help as well, by finding a therapist or sup-<br />port group.
  Change happens not by trying to make yourself change but by becoming conscious
  of what’s not working. You can then ask your higher self for help in releasing
  the old and bringing in the new pattern. Remember, the darkest hour is just
  before the dawn — change often occurs just when you’ve given up, or when you
  least expect it.

    >Using the Mirror Process</span
  >
</h4>
<p>
  In using the world as your mirror, you must deal with the external realities
  of your life in whatever way you need to handle them. But as soon as possible,
  before, during, or after you deal with the externals, check inside to find out
  what is being shown to you.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if someone is angry at you and blames or criticizes you, you may
  need to say to them, “Stop blaming me. I don’t want to hear your judgments and
  criticisms of me. If you can talk about your own feelings, I’ll be glad to
  listen, but if you keep attacking me, I’m going to leave.” If they take more
  responsibility for their feelings (for example, “I felt hurt and angry when
  you didn’t call me yesterday”), then you will probably be able to continue the
  conversation on a more productive level. If they continue to blame you and
  focus on your faults, you may need to support yourself by walking out of the
  room and refusing to continue the conversation until they stop their attack.
</p>
<p>
  Either way, you have handled the external situation. Now, as soon as you get a
  chance, check inside yourself and ask, “I wonder what this person’s anger is
  mirroring in me?” You may realize that you have been feeling very angry and
  critical toward yourself lately. Or perhaps you will discover that a part of
  you is upset because you haven’t been paying enough attention to yourself.
  When other people want more from you, it’s usually an indication that you want
  more from yourself. It may in fact be a signal that it’s time to show up and
  be more present with your own needs and feelings. Interestingly, other people
  in our lives often start feeling better when we become more present with
  ourselves.
</p>
<p>
  A friend of mine discovered that her boyfriend had been seeing another woman
  and lying to her about it. She was very hurt and angry, particularly to
  discover the dishonesty. They had a long talk in which she was able to express
  her feelings to him. Then she took some time alone for a while to sort things
  out on her own.
</p>
<p>
  When she was alone, she asked herself, “Is there some way I’m lying to myself,
  some way I’m not being totally truthful and honest with myself, that would
  cause me to attract a dishonest man?” She let go of thinking about it and went
  to work. By the end of the day she realized she had often felt this man was
  not fully present with her, was not being real with her. But in the past, she
  had denied and covered up these feelings because she was afraid to confront
  him with what she felt and intuitively knew. Thus, she effectively lied to
  herself and supported him in his deceptions as well.
</p>
<p>
  She realized this was a lesson in learning to trust her feelings more and to
  have the courage to express and support them. She started to do this more with
  her boyfriend, and they eventually worked out a more honest, communicative
  relationship. She might also have chosen not to continue the relationship.
  What matters is that she received the gift from it — learning to trust and
  express her feelings.
</p>
<p>
  If you are emotionally triggered by something a person does, the two of you
  are probably mirrors for each other. It may appear that you have opposing
  viewpoints, but internally you are probably similar. One of you is acting out
  one side of the internal conflict, while the other plays out the other side.
</p>
<p>
  For example, one person may want more commitment in a relationship, while the
  other wants more freedom. They become extremely polarized on this issue and
  truly believe they want opposite things. However, if one person suddenly
  switches her position (the one who wanted commitment suddenly wants freedom),
  the other person often swings to the opposite polarity. The reason for this is
  that they are attempting to resolve an inner conflict they both have — the
  desire for closeness and security and the need for independence and autonomy
  (which may feel like the fear of loneliness versus the fear of entrapment).
</p>
<p>
  Once people look inside and become more aware of their feelings, they often
  recognize that they have simply projected their inner conflict onto the
  outside world so that they could recognize and deal with it. If a person truly
  and unequivocally wants a committed relationship, he will simply attract
  another person who wants the same thing. If someone feels completely clear
  about wanting to explore being with many partners, he simply does it. By using
  the mirror process, you can recognize what you really feel and learn to be
  more honest with yourself. Once you recognize an internal conflict, you can
  acknowledge that both polarities are really within you and find ways to honor
  both of the energies.
</p>
