<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>A New Way Of Life</strong></h3>
<p>
  <span class="text-huge"><strong>W</strong></span
  >e are living in a very exciting and powerful time. On the deepest level of
  consciousness, a radical transformation is taking place. As the evolution of
  human consciousness gains greater and greater momentum, we are being
  challenged, on a planetary level, to let go of our present way of life and
  create a new one. In a sense, our “old world” is dying, and a new world is
  coming into being.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  For many of us, the old world was based on an external focus – having lost our
  fundamental spiritual connection, we have believed that the material world is
  the only reality. Thus, feeling essentially lost, empty, and alone, we have
  continually attempted to find happiness and fulfillment through external
  “things” – money, material possessions, relationships, work, fame, food,
  drugs, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="background-color: #4ce64c; color: #4c4ce6"
    >The new world is being built as we open to the higher power of the universe
    within us and consciously allow that creative energy to move through us. As
    each of us connects with our inner spiritual awareness, we learn that the
    creative power of the universe is inside of us. We also learn that we can
    create our own experience of reality and take responsibility for doing so.
    The change begins within each individual, but as more and more individuals
    are transformed, the mass consciousness is increasingly affected.</span

<p>
  <span style="background-color: #4ce64c; color: #4c4ce6"
    >My observation that a profound transformation of consciousness is taking
    place in our world at this time is based on the changes I see within myself,
    those around me, and in our society. It is affirmed by feedback I receive
    from thousands of people I work with all over the world.</span

      >Living in the Light is about this transformation of consciousness, within
      each individual and in the world. My use of the terms “old world” and “new
      world” throughout the book refer to the old way of living that we are
      relinquishing, and the new one that we are creating.</mark

</p>
<p>
  For many people, this time may be distressing, because the world situation
  and/or our personal lives may seem to be going from bad to worse. It’s as if
  many things are falling apart and will continue to do so with even greater
  intensity, but on the deepest level, I do not feel this is negative. It is
  upsetting to us to the degree that we are emotionally attached to our old way
  of living and steadfastly follow old patterns, rather than trying to open our
  eyes to the profound changes that are occurring.
</p>
<p>
  Paradoxical as it may seem, these changes are the greatest blessing that any
  of us could possibly imagine. The truth is that the<br />way of life that we
  have been following for centuries no longer works. While appropriate for its
  time, it cannot take us where we need and desire to go. The focus on
  materialism and the external world was necessary in a time when our primary
  challenge was physical survival. Our patriarchal values and the traditional
  roles of men and women may have been necessary in order to ensure the
  protection of our families for a certain period of time in our evolutionary
  process.
</p>
<p>
  At this time, many human beings (and other species as well) on the earth are
  still struggling for physical survival. Yet there are an<br />increasing
  number of us who no longer have to be preoccupied primarily with sheer
  survival. We have the opportunity, and thus the responsibility, to begin
  looking for deeper fulfillment on spiritual, mental, and emotional levels. We
  are searching for greater<br />meaning and purpose in our lives, and for ways
  to live more responsibly and harmoniously on our planet.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="text-big"
    >While some people throughout history have led relatively meaningful and
    satisfying lives, I’m afraid that most of us have never found the
    fulfillment that we have yearned for. Our cultural conditioning has not
    given us the tools to develop a healthy connection with our inner realms of
    soul, intuition, and feeling, and to integrate them with our external
    world.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  In a way, it’s as if we’ve been in school for our entire lives, receiving an
  education that teaches the exact opposite of the way<br />the universe
  actually functions. We try to make things work as we’ve been taught, and we
  may even enjoy some degree of success, but for most of us things never seem to
  work out as well as we had hoped. That perfect relationship never
  materializes, or if it does, it soon sours or fades away. Or it may seem as
  though there is never quite enough money; we never feel truly secure or
  abundant.<br />Perhaps we don’t get the appreciation, recognition, or success
  that we want. Even if we do achieve some of these things, we still may suffer
  from a vague sense that there must be something more, some deeper meaning.
  Some of us may actually connect with that deeper meaning and feel increasingly
  fulfilled and expanded by a growing spiritual awareness. Nevertheless, there
  are stubborn and sometimes puzzling old patterns and areas of life where we
  experience great pain and confusion.
</p>
<p>
  Thus, our first task in building the new world is to admit that our “life
  education” has not necessarily taught us a satisfying way to live. We must
  learn a way of life that is very different from the way we approached things
  before. This may not be easy for us, and it will take time, commitment, and
  courage. Therefore, it’s very important to be compassionate with ourselves, to
  continually remind ourselves what a tremendous task we are undertaking. It
  will not be accomplished overnight; in fact, it is a lifelong process.
</p>
<p>
  Just as a baby learns to walk by falling down repeatedly, we must remember
  that we are babies in the new world. We will learn by making lots of mistakes
  and often we may feel ignorant, frightened, or unsure of ourselves. But we
  would not get angry at a baby every time he fell down (if we did, he’d
  probably never learn to walk with full confidence and power), so we must try
  not to criticize ourselves if we are not able to live and express ourselves as
  fully as we wish immediately.
</p>
<p>
  We are now learning to live more fully in accordance with the laws of the
  universe. We are challenged to explore all aspects of our human experience and
  to develop all levels of our being – the spiritual, mental, and emotional as
  well as the physical.
</p>
<p>
  As we do this work, we experience an increasing sense of wholeness,
  empowerment, aliveness, and a feeling of being “on purpose” in our lives. So,
  although letting go of the old world may seem difficult at times, it is well
  worth the commitment and hard work it takes to gradually make this transition
  into the new world.

</h4>
<p>
  Sit or lie down, relax, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths. As you
  exhale, imagine that you are letting go of every-<br />thing that you don’t
  want or need. Easily, without effort, let any frustrations, tiredness, or
  worries melt away. This is a time to<br />release an old way of life that no
  longer works for you. Imagine that your old ways, your old patterns, and all
  the obstacles to achieving what you truly want are gently dissolved and
  leaving your body with each breath. Every time you exhale, and release a
  little of your old limitations, you create more space inside of you for
  something new.
</p>
<p>
  After doing this for a few minutes, begin to imagine that every time you
  inhale you are breathing in life energy, the life force of the<br />universe.
  Within this life energy is everything you need and desire – love, power,
  health, beauty, strength, abundance. Breathe it in with each inhalation.
  Imagine a new way of life opening up, filling you with aliveness, vitality,
  and energy. Pretend your life is exactly the way you want it to be. Imagine
  this new life is here, now, and savor it.
</p>
<p>
  When the meditation feels complete, gently open your eyes and come back into
  the room. See if you can retain that sense of newness in yourself. Remember
  that you are now in the process of creating a new life for yourself.

<p>
  <span class="text-huge"><strong>T</strong></span
  >he foundation for life in the new world is built on the understanding that
  there is a higher intelligence, a fundamental creative power or energy in the
  universe that is the source and substance of all existence. The words and
  concepts that have been used to describe this power are innumerable. Here are
  just a few:

  These terms are attempts to express an experience or knowingness that is
  difficult to convey in words and rational concepts. Each of us has this
  experience within us; the words we choose to describe it are merely the labels
  that suit us best.
</p>
<p>
  I seldom use the word God, as it has so many confusing connotations for so
  many. Frequently, people associate it with early religious training, which is
  no longer meaningful to them. Some may think of God as someone or something
  outside of themselves: the “old man in the sky with the long white beard.” I
  prefer terms such as higher power, the universe, spirit, or inner guidance. In
  this book, I will use some of these terms interchangeably to refer to our
  spiritual source, the essential creative intelligence and power within us. If
  any of these terms are not particularly meaningful to you, please feel free to
  substitute whatever word you prefer.
</p>
<p>
  For the first twenty years of my life, my connection to the spiritual aspect
  of my being was largely undeveloped. I had no conscious experience of, or
  belief in, a higher power of any sort. I have had to move through many levels
  of doubt, skepticism, disbelief, and fear in order to arrive at the great
  trust I now have in the higher power of the universe that is within me and
  within everyone and everything that exists. I have not accepted anything on
  blind faith, so in a sense I have had to “prove” everything to myself through
  my life experiences. As I’ve learned to place my trust in the higher power of
  the universe and to live in accordance with universal principles, the changes
  I have felt and seen in my life are truly miraculous.
</p>
<p>
  Those of you who have felt deep spiritual awareness throughout your lives
  already have a solid foundation to build upon. For those of you who have felt
  spiritually “disconnected” as I have, I hope my words will support and
  encourage you to find this inner connection for yourself. There is no specific
  way to do this; everyone’s experience is different. If this is something that
  you desire, ask within yourself that you be guided into an experience of your
  own spiritual nature. This may take some time, but if you desire it, it will
  happen. The words and exercises in this book may help you with this.
</p>
<p>
  The universe has both personal and impersonal aspects; as I surrender and
  trust more, I find my relationship with this higher power becoming more
  personal. I can sometimes sense a presence within me, guiding me, loving me,
  teaching me, encouraging me. In this personal aspect, the universe can be
  teacher, guide, friend, mother, father, lover, creative genius, or fairy
  godmother. In other words, many of my needs and desires can be fulfilled
  through this inner connection. I often find the most powerful communion with
  the universe when I am alone, especially out in nature. At such times, the
  places inside of me that sometimes feel empty are filled with the energy of
  spirit. Here I find a guiding presence that nudges me in the direction I need
  to go, and helps me to learn the lesson that lies in taking each step along my
  path.

  Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and take a few deep
  breaths. Each time you exhale, relax your body more and more. Then take a few
  more deep breaths and, each time you exhale, relax your mind. Let your
  thoughts drift by without holding onto any of them. Allow your mind to go out
  of focus. Relax your awareness into a deep place within you.
</p>
<p>
  Imagine that there is a very powerful presence within you. This presence is
  totally loving, strong, and wise. It is nurturing, protecting, guiding, and
  caring for you. At times it can be very strong and forceful. It can also be
  very light, joyful, and playful. As you get to know and trust it, it will make
  your life exciting, meaningful, and fulfilling.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  You may get an image or a feeling or a physical sensation that represents this
  higher presence. Even if you don’t see or feel a<br />thing, assume it is
  there regardless.<br />Relax and enjoy the feeling or thought that you are
  being totally taken care of by the universe. Say this affirmation to yourself
  silently or aloud, “I feel and trust the presence of the universe in my life.”
