            >This book has three parts: the Past, the Present, and the
            Future.</strong

    >
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Past…</strong> examines the real causes of the financial crisis
    we’re facing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>The Present…</strong> analyzes where you are today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Future…</strong> explores your second chance for your money and
    your life and how you can use the opportunities that are found in crisis and
    adversity to create the life you want.
</p>
<p>
    The most important word today is crisis. Remember that there are two parts,
    two sides, to the word crisis: danger and opportunity.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Your second chance requires that you avoid the dangers that lie ahead and be
    prepared for the opportunities that exist in a growing, global financial
    crisis.

    I was in a Starbucks the other day and ran into a friend I had not seen in
    years. Although happy to see him, I was surprised to find him working behind
    the counter.
</p>
<p>“How long have you worked here?” I asked.</p>
<p>“About five months,” he replied as he took my order.</p>
<p>“What happened?” I asked.</p>
<p>
    “Well, after the market crashed in 2007, I lost my job. I found another one,
    but that job soon disappeared, too. Finally, after burning through our
    retirement and savings, we lost our house. We just couldn’t hang on.” He
    continued: “Don’t worry. We’ve been working. We’re not unemployed. We both
    have jobs, but we’re not making much money. So I work here, at Starbucks, to
    make a few bucks. Get it, I work for bucks at Starbucks?” He said, laughing
    out loud.
</p>
<p>
    Stepping aside so the customers behind me could place their orders, I asked,
    “So what are you doing for your future?”
</p>
<p>
    “I’m back in school. I’m getting another Masters degree. It’s kind of fun
    being in school again. I even take a few classes with my son. He’s earning
    his first Masters degree.”
</p>
<p>“Paid for with student loans?” I asked</p>
<p>
    “Yeah. What else can we do? I know they’re terrible loans. I know I’ll be
    working for the rest of my life, just to pay off my loan. My son has more
    time to pay off his. But we all need more education if we want high-paying
    jobs. We have to make money. We need to earn a living. So we’re in school.”
</p>
<p>
    I paid for my coffee and was handed a steaming cup. When I offered him a
    tip, he refused… and I know why he refused. So I wished him luck, and walked
    out the door.
</p>
<p>
    Part One of this book is about the past. More specifically, how we got into
    this global financial crisis.
</p>
<p>As George Orwell wrote in his book 1984,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    “In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.”
