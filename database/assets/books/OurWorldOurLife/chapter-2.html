    <strong>The Man Who Could See The Future</strong>
</h3>

<p style="text-align: center">
    "Most of my advances were by mistake. You uncover what is when you get rid
    of what isn't.” – R. Buckminster Fuller
</p>
<hr />
<p>
    In the summer of 1967, a classmate and I hitchhiked from New York City to
    Montreal, Canada. At the time, Andy Andreasen and I were both 20-year-old
    students attending the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New
    York. We were hitchhiking to Montreal to see the future.
</p>
<p>
    Montreal was the site for Expo 67, the World's Fair dedicated to the future.
    The centerpiece of the World's Fair was the U.S. pavilion, a massive
    geodesic dome that could be seen for miles. The creator of the dome was Dr.
    R. Buckminster Fuller, considered to be one of the greatest geniuses of our
    time.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Fuller had a reputation as a futurist and was often called "Grandfather
    of the Future." It seemed appropriate that the U.S. government had chosen
    Dr. Fuller's dome, a structure that represented the future, to be the U.S.
    Pavilion.

    Dr. Fuller, or "Bucky" as many called him, was an enigma; he was someone who
    could not be defined. Harvard University claims him as one of their more
    prominent alums, yet Bucky did not graduate from Harvard. Although Fuller
    never graduated from college, he was awarded 47 honorary degrees over his
    lifetime.
</p>
<p>
    The AIA, the American Institute of Architects, consider him to be one of the
    world's leading architects. Bucky was not an architect by training, yet his
    buildings are found all over the world. In the lobby of the AIA
    headquarters, a bust of Fuller is prominently displayed.
</p>
<p>
    He is considered one of the most accomplished Americans in history, having
    more than 2,000 patents after his name.
</p>
<p>
    Fuller authored many books ranging from science and philosophy to poetry.
    President Ronald Reagan awarded Bucky the Presidential Freedom Medal in
    1982, and he was once considered for the Nobel Prize.
</p>
<p>
    Although extremely accomplished, Bucky often referred to himself as a "just
    a little guy."

        ><i><strong>Poor Dad and Bucky</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    It was my father, the person I refer to as my "poor dad," who first
    introduced me to Dr. Fuller. In the late 1950s, while I was still in
    elementary school, my dad and I would sit for hours building Bucky's models
    out of glue and sticks. We created the tetrahedrons, octahedrons, and
    icosahedrons that Fuller said were "the building blocks of the Universe." My
    poor dad and Bucky had a lot in common. Both were extremely bright men who
    thrived in the world of academics, especially math, science, and design.
    Both men were committed to a better world, a world that worked for everyone.
    Both men dedicated their lives to serving humanity and world peace.
</p>
<p>
    In 1964, when Dr. Fuller made the cover of Time magazine, my dad was
    ecstatic.

    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Standing in the Future</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    In 1967, Andy and I, both Bucky devotees, could not wait to visit the U.S.
    Pavilion and stand inside Fuller's massive dome. The feeling inside the dome
    was magical, a surreal environment of peace and possibilities. I never
    dreamed that one day I would actually study with the "Grandfather of the
    Future."
</p>
<p>
    In 1981, I was invited to spend a week studying with Dr. Fuller at a lodge
    outside of Lake Tahoe, California. The title of the conference was "The
    Future of Business." It was a week that forever changed the direction of my
    life
</p>
<p>
    I wish I could say I attended the lecture series to learn more about world
    peace, math, science, design, generalized principles, or philosophy. I
    can't. My primary reason for attending the conference was to learn how
    Fuller could predict the future. I was motivated by pure greed, not world
    peace. I wanted to learn how to predict the future so I could use that
    knowledge to make more money.
</p>
<p>
    On the last day of the event something happened to me. I wish I could
    explain it, but my limited vocabulary makes it hard for me to describe the
    experience.
</p>
<p>
    I was standing behind the video camera and tripod, working as a volunteer
    and taping the entire event. I volunteered to stand behind the camera
    because I was falling asleep as a participant in the audience. Fuller was
    not an especially dynamic speaker. In fact, I would say he was boring—he
    mumbled and used words I didn't understand.
</p>
<p>
    Just as the event was coming to a close, I looked up from the eyepiece of
    the camera, directly at Bucky, and a gentle a wave of energy went through
    me. I could feel my heart open and I began to cry. They weren't tears of
    sadness or pain, but tears of gratitude for this man's courage to do what he
    had been doing for years: guiding and teaching and looking into the future.
</p>
<p>
    John Denver wrote and recorded a song dedicated to Dr. Fuller, after Bucky
    touched and inspired John's life. The title of the song is "What One Man Can
    Do."
</p>
<p>
    John Denver's tribute to Bucky Fuller in that song does a far better job of
    describing the experience I had that day with Bucky than I can do with words
    in this book.
</p>
<p>The words in John Denver's song that have always moved me are these:</p>
<p><i>It's hard to tell the truth</i></p>
<p><i>When no one wants to listen</i></p>
<p><i>When no one really cares</i></p>
<p><i>What's going on</i></p>
<p><i>And it's hard to stand alone</i></p>
<p><i>When you need someone beside you</i></p>
<p><i>Your spirit and your faith</i></p>
<p><i>They must be strong</i></p>
<p>Followed by the refrain…</p>
<p><i>What one man can do is dream</i></p>
<p><i>What one man can do is love</i></p>
<p><i>What one man can do is change the world</i></p>
<p><i>And make it young again</i></p>
<p><i>Here you see what one man can do</i></p>
<p>
    Since this book is about second chances, I describe that event with Bucky
    Fuller because it was one of the many second chances I have had in my life.
    I returned to Honolulu a changed person.
</p>
<p>
    At that time, in 1981, I had factories in Taiwan, Korea, and Hawaii that
    manufactured licensed products for the rock and roll industry. My company
    was producing products for the rock bands Pink Floyd, Duran Duran, Judas
    Priest, Van Halen, Boy George, Ted Nugent, REO Speedwagon, and The Police. I
    loved the business. My factories rolled out hats, wallets, and bags with
    faces and logos of the bands silk-screened on the products. On the weekends
    I would be at concerts watching my products being scooped up by raving,
    happy fans. It was a great business. I was single, living on the beach in
    Waikiki with neighbors like Tom Selleck, and making a lot of money… which
    used to make me happy.
</p>
<p>
    The problem was that Fuller had touched my heart and I knew, in my heart,
    that my days of sex, drugs, rock and roll, and money were coming to an end.
    I kept asking myself, "What can I do to make the world a better place?" And
    "What am I doing with my life?"
</p>
<p>
    In 1981, I was 34 years old. I now had three professions. I had gone to the
    U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in New York, received my Bachelor of Science
    Degree, and a third mate's license to sail on oil tankers. I had gone to
    U.S. Navy Flight School and learned how to fly professionally. I briefly
    considered flying for the airlines, but when I returned from Vietnam, I knew
    that, although I loved flying, my days as a pilot were over. I was now an
    entrepreneur with a global manufacturing and distribution business. My rock
    and roll products were in national chains like JCPenney, Tower Records, and
    Spencer's gift stores, at concerts with the bands, and offered by retailers
    in countries around the world through worldwide distributors.
</p>
<p>
    My problem was I had met Bucky Fuller. And when I returned to my factory in
    Honolulu, my mind would drift back to what I had experienced in Montreal. As
    I've said, standing in the magical environment of that dome, never dreaming
    I would ever meet the man who designed it… then meeting him and knowing that
    my life was changing yet again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>My Spiritual Job</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    Rather than listen to rock and roll music, I was now listening to John
    Denver's music. Whenever I listened to John sing What One Man Can Do,the
    song he dedicated to Fuller, I would ask myself over and over again: "What
    am I supposed to be doing with my life?"
</p>
<p>
    Whenever I listened to rock and roll music, the only thing it inspired me to
    do was to go to the nightclubs of Waikiki.
</p>
<p>
    When I listened to John Denver's songs, my thinking started in my heart.
    Rather than stay out late in nightclubs, I spent more time alone, surfing or
    hiking just being with the beauty of nature. On weekends, I spent time in
    personal development workshops learning how to become a better person,
    emotionally and spiritually. My more gentle side raised a few eyebrows among
    my Marine Corps friends and I found myself spending more time with business
    groups focused on solving social problems in communities around town than
    with associates in rock and roll or retailing.
</p>
<p>
    Slowly it dawned on me that we go to school with the hope of finding a
    financial profession known as a job. After meeting Fuller,
</p>
<p>
    I realized I was looking for my spiritual profession, my spiritual work, my
    spiritual job and my life's purpose.
</p>
<p>
    From 1981 to 1983, I studied with Dr. Fuller on three different occasions
    during the summers. Between summers, my new friends and I would get together
    to "group study" Fuller's books. His books are not very easy to comprehend,
    so we would agree to study a chapter each week then get together at one of
    our houses to discuss and "mind-map" Fuller's thoughts in that chapter.
</p>
<p>
    Mind mapping is a method of using color and sketches, rather than words, to
    organize and prioritize Fuller's thoughts in the chapter. The sketches were
    done on large sheets of flip chart paper and started with a core or central
    concept. The key to mind mapping is color and sketches, using very, very,
    few words. Using very few words forces the participant to put words and
    thoughts into pictures, which intensifies the learning and discussion
    process.
</p>
<p>
    As we all know, two or more minds are better than one… except in school,
    where two or more minds working together is known as cheating. The group
    study—using discussion, color, and pictures—was exciting, stimulating,
    challenging, and never boring. Rather than late nights in nightclubs, I was
    now spending late nights in book study groups. I knew this was my second
    chance to find my life's purpose. Rather than go to school to learn how to
    transport oil, or go to school to learn to rain terror from the skies, or go
    to school to learn how to manufacture and sell more rock and roll products,
    I was now "in school," a new second chance school, learning how to be a
    better human being, learning— possibly—to be a person who might make a
    difference in the world.
</p>
<p>
    The problem was, I had no idea then what my spiritual job was… or was to be.
    From 1981 to 1983, I dedicated a lot of time studying Fuller's work. And
    1983 was the last summer of events that I spent with him. He closed the
    conference with the words "Good-bye darling people. See you next summer."
    But he didn't see us the following summer. He died three weeks later on July
    1, 1983.

<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Changes on the Horizon</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    By 1984, I knew I had to make changes… the problem was I was not sure what I
    was supposed to do… so I just decided to do something. As the saying goes:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    "Sometimes you have to let go of what you love doing so you can do what you
    are supposed to do."
</p>
<p>
    I had also reread the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull, written by Richard
    Bach and first published in 1970.
</p>
<p>
    The following is from Wikipedia, and gives you an idea of what the book is
    about:
</p>
<p>
    "The book tells the story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who is
    bored with the daily squabbles over food. Seized by a passion for flight, he
    pushes himself, learning everything he can about flying, until finally his
    unwillingness to conform results in his expulsion from his flock. An
    outcast, he continues to learn, becoming increasingly pleased with his
    abilities as he leads a peaceful and happy life.
</p>
<p>
    One day, Jonathan is met by two gulls who take him to a 'higher plane of
    existence' in that there is no heaven but a better world found through
    perfection of knowledge, where he meets other gulls who love to fly. He
    discovers that his sheer tenacity and desire to learn makes him 'pretty well
    a one-in-a-million bird.' In this new place, Jonathan befriends the wisest
    gull, Chiang, who takes him beyond his previous learning, teaching him how
    to move instantaneously to anywhere else in the Universe. The secret, Chiang
    says, is to 'begin by knowing that you have already arrived.' Not satisfied
    with his new life, Jonathan returns to Earth to find others like him, to
    bring them his learning and to spread his love for flight. His mission is
    successful, gathering around him others who have been outlawed for not
    conforming. Ultimately, the very first of his students, Fletcher Lynd
    Seagull, becomes a teacher in his own right and Jonathan leaves to teach
    other flocks."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Leaps of Faith</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    One important lesson I got from Jonathan Livingston Seagull is that
    sometimes a person needs to let go and let the currents of life carry them
    to where they are supposed to go.
</p>
<p>
    From the summer of 1983 to end of 1984, I began preparing to let go and let
    the currents of life take me.
</p>
<p>
    That process began with informing my two partners in my rock and roll
    business that I was "letting go" and moving on. When they asked where I was
    going, I mumbled something about letting the currents of life carry me. When
    that went over their heads, I simply said, "I'm taking a leap of faith into
    the unknown" and, in October of 1983, we began the buy-out process that
    would transition me out of the business.
</p>
<p>
    In January of 1984, as I was tying up loose ends in Hawaii, New York,
    Taiwan, and Korea, I met the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Her name
    was Kim and she wanted nothing to do with me. For the next six months, I
    kept asking her out and for six months her answer was always the same: "No."
</p>
<p>
    Finally, she agreed to go out. We spent dinner and a long walk on Waikiki
    Beach together, talking until the sun came up. From late that night until
    early the next morning I talked about Bucky Fuller and the possibility of a
    life's purpose, a person's spiritual job. She was the first woman I had ever
    met who was interested in these subjects.
</p>
<p>
    Over the next few months, we saw each other regularly. She was part of my
    "letting go" process. She was with me when I said a tearful good-bye to my
    partners and the workers in the Honolulu factory. Kim and I knew we, too,
    would soon be saying good-bye. She had her career in advertising in Honolulu
    and I was leaping into nothing. One day, as the day of reckoning approached,
    Kim said, "I want to go with you." In December of 1984, Kim and I held hands
    and took our leap of faith into the unknown. Without a doubt, 1985 was the
    worst year of our lives. Little did we know that, unfortunately, there would
    be years ahead that would make 1985 look easy by comparison.
</p>
<p>
    We wish we could say it has all been easy, all peaches and cream. But it's
    been hell. Even today, in 2014, although financially and professionally
    "successful" we still have to deal with life in the real world, a world of
    greed, lies, dishonesty, legal hassles, and crime.
</p>
<p>
    In spite of the hardships and heartbreak, the journey has been very much
    like the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull described. It has been a process
    to test our spirit and our dedication to our process… to see if we would
    quit when the going got too tough.
</p>
<p>
    The great news is that we have met many great people, different types of
    people we might never have met if Kim had remained with the ad agency and I
    had remained in manufacturing.
</p>
<p>
    Wikipedia best describes the people we meet and befriend along the way, in
    its summary of Part 2 of Jonathan Livingston Seagull:
</p>
<p>
    "Jonathan transcends into a society where all the gulls enjoy flying. He is
    only capable of this after practicing hard alone for a long time. The
    learning process, linking the highly experienced teacher and the diligent
    student, is raised into almost sacred levels. They, regardless of the
    all-immense difference, are sharing something of great importance that can
    bind them together:
</p>
<p>
    'You've got to understand that a seagull is an unlimited idea of freedom, an
    image of the Great Gull.' He realizes that you have to be true to yourself:
    'You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and
    nothing can stand in your way.'"
</p>
<p>
    There were many times in 1985 when Kim and I had no place to live and no
    money to eat. We survived by living in an old, brown Toyota and in a
    friend's basement. As I said, our faith was being tested.
</p>
<p>
    In the fall of 1985, the stream of life carried us to Australia where we
    found people who loved what we were teaching. We were using games to teach
    socially responsible entrepreneurship and investing. By December of 1985, we
    actually made a small profit on a seminar we held in Sydney—and that is one
    of the reasons why Kim and I love Australia and will always be grateful to
    the people of Australia. We had let go and the current of life carried us to
    Australia and Australians gave us chance to develop as teachers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Change of Friends</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    One day in 1986, out of the blue, I received a call from John Denver's
    Windstar Foundation. John was hosting an event in Aspen, Colorado and wanted
    to know if I would be one of the guest speakers, along with several other
    entrepreneurs including Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, founders of Ben
    &amp; Jerry's ice cream. Of course I said "Yes."
</p>
<p>
    Being in a large tent on John's property in Aspen was much like being in
    Bucky's dome in Montreal. The feeling of magic, wonder, and possibilities
    was the same.
</p>
<p>
    For some reason, I did not speak on my rock and roll business. It didn't
    seem to fit. For some reason—and totally unprepared—I spoke on education and
    learning. I spoke about the pain I went through in school, about knowing
    what I wanted to study but being forced to study subjects I had no interest
    in. I spoke about the emotional pain I went through in failing high school
    English twice, because I could not write well. I spoke for the kids like me,
    kids who wanted to learn but didn't like school. I spoke about how so many
    children have their spirits crushed in the traditional process of learning.
    At the end of my talk, I asked everyone in the group to close their eyes,
    join hands, and listen to Whitney Houston's latest release, The Greatest
    Love of All. The opening line of the song fit the mood and the message:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">"I believe the children are our future…"</p>
<p>
    There weren't many dry eyes in the audience as I left the stage in silence.
    The audience, this group of "seagulls," were hugging each other, some
    crying, much as I had cried that day in 1981 when I was in the audience that
    first time with Bucky Fuller. The tears were of love, not sadness. They were
    tears of responsibility, not blame. They were tears of gratitude… gratitude
    for the gift of life. And they were tears of courage, knowing that changing
    the world requires courage, courage that comes from the heart. Many in this
    group of "seagulls" already knew that the word courage comes from the French
    word, "le coeur," the heart. Windstar was a gathering of gulls, most of whom
    already knew how to fly. They knew flying took courage.
</p>
<p>
    Kim was waiting for me as I stepped down from the stage and we hugged
    silently. We knew we had found our spiritual profession, our spiritual job
    and our life's purpose. We knew then that we'd found what was to become, and
    still is, our life's work.
</p>

    Ironically being a teacher was the not on my list of answers to the question
    "What do want to be when you grow up?" Being an attorney was "a higher
    calling" than being a teacher. It is not that I hated school. I hated being
    forced to learn what I did not want to learn. I hated not learning what I
    wanted to learn, which was to understand money and be financially free like
    my rich dad. I did not want to be a slave to a paycheck, job security, and a
    schoolteacher's pension, like my poor dad.

    Once Kim and I were clear on our spiritual jobs, our little educational
    company expanded to New Zealand, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, and the U.S.
    business boomed.
</p>
<p>
    Ten years later, in 1994, when we sold that business to our partner, Kim and
    I were financially free. Kim was 37 years old and I was 47. We achieved
    financial freedom without jobs, without government support, and without a
    retirement plan filled with stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
</p>
<p>
    When people began asking us how we achieved financial freedom without the
    traditional investment and retirement plans, Kim and I knew it was time for
    us to begin our new second chance.
</p>
<p>
    Following one of Buckminster Fuller's generalized principles—a principle
    that is true in all cases, no exceptions—we began our next business. Today
    that business is known as The Rich Dad Company.
</p>
<p>The generalized principle we followed was:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    "The more people I serve, the more effective I become."
</p>
<p>
    With the intent on serving more people, Kim and I began developing our
    CASHFLOW® game and I began writing Rich Dad Poor Dad. On my 50th birthday,
    April 8, 1997, The Rich Dad Company was officially launched. Our mission:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    "To elevate the financial well being of humanity."

</p>
<p>
    As I stated in Chapter One of this book, the world of money is changing and,
    unfortunately, millions of people are not. The reason Kim and I continued on
    with The Rich Dad Company, although we are both financially free, is because
    of the company mission, a mission of offering more people a second chance at
    money and life. Today, through the development of electronic games and apps,
    The Rich Dad Company finds itself poised for yet another second chance, a
    chance to serve more people using the tools and technology of the
    Information Age. The beauty of second chances is that you can have as many
    as you need or want… without any limits. Each of us has the power to choose
    to pursue a second chance, as opposed to whining about what might have been.
    And the more we learn, and the more aware each of us is about the
    ever-changing world we live in, the better our odds of succeeding as we
    commit to a second chance.

    Dr. Fuller's last book was Grunch of Giants. GRUNCH is an acronym, which
    stands for <strong>G</strong>ross <strong>U</strong>niversal
    <strong>C</strong>ash <strong>H</strong>eist.
</p>
<p>
    Grunch was published after his death in 1983. Grunch was Fuller's only book
    to focus on many of the same things my rich dad was concerned about,
    specifically how the monetary system is designed to steal our wealth.
</p>
<p>
    Reading Grunch of Giants in 1983 pushed me over the edge. I knew I could no
    longer be a manufacturer. Although I did not know what to do, I knew I had
    to do something. I knew too much and I could no longer stay silent. Fuller
    had taught us how to see the future and even then I could see this crisis
    coming, a financial crisis that began in our educational system.
</p>
<p>
    In the following chapters, I will explain what I learned and why we are in a
    financial crisis we face today.
</p>
<p>
    This cash heist is not new. It has been going on for a long time. For those
    who seek a second chance, understanding what Fuller calls the Grunch of
    Giants— and what he saw for the future—is essential to creating a brighter
    future for you and your family.
