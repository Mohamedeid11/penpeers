    "I just invent, then wait until man comes around to needing what I've
    invented."&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">– R. Buckminster Fuller</p>
<hr />
<p>
    It took me awhile to realize that Bucky Fuller's ability to predict the
    future had nothing to do with picking stocks, timing markets, betting on
    horses, or predicting who will win the World Series. His vision of the
    future had to do with god's view of the future.
</p>
<p>
    Bucky was hesitant to use the word god because, for many people, that word
    carried a lot of "religious dogma," emotion, and controversy. Fuller did not
    think god was a white guy, a Jew, an Arab, or an Asian. Rather than use the
    word god, he preferred the Native American term, the Great Spirit. The Great
    Spirit is the invisible energy that binds all things in "universe," not just
    heaven and earth.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever I use the term god in this book, please know I am not making
    religious references. I respect a person's right to choose—to believe in
    god, or not to believe in god or follow any religion. Simply said, I believe
    in religious freedom and the freedom to choose whether or not they believe
    in god.
</p>
<p>
    The same is true for politics. I am not a Republican or Democrat. I have no
    dog in that fight. In fact, I like my dog more than I like most politicians.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Human Evolution</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    Fuller was not a futurist in the arena of money. He was a futurist on the
    Great Spirit's wishes for humanity's evolution. He believed humans were
    god's longterm experiment, placed here on "spaceship earth" to see if humans
    could evolve… if they could, or would, turn planet earth into a heaven on
    earth, or hell on earth.
</p>
<p>
    Fuller believed Great Spirit wanted all humans to be rich. He often said,
    "There are six billion billionaires on earth." (That was in the 1980s. Today
    he would say "seven billion billionaires.") In the 1980s there were fewer
    than 50 documented billionaires. A far cry from the "six billion" that Bucky
    cited. By 2008 there were 1,150. Today that figure's projected at 1,645.
</p>
<p>
    Fuller predicted that humanity had reached a critical evolutionary point. If
    humans did not evolve from greed and selfishness to generosity and
    abundance, humans—as an experiment on earth—would end. He often referred to
    the rich and powerful who hoarded "god's abundance" only for themselves as
    "blood clots." He believed that if humans did not "evolve" we would not only
    kill ourselves, but also kill the ecology of planet earth.
</p>
<p>
    The reason Fuller sought to identify the Generalized Principles is because
    they are the invisible forces that run the universe. In other words, the
    Generalized Principles were the operating principles of the Great Spirit,
    and the Great Spirit wanted all humans and all life on planet earth to
    thrive. Fuller believed there were 200 to 300 Generalized Principles. At the
    time of his death he had discovered about 50. I am aware of and use about
    five of them.
</p>
<p>
    In his writing and talks, he was critical of a few greedy, powerful people
    who used humans and the resources of planet earth only for their personal
    wealth. He believed that if humans did not shift from greed to
    generosity—humans working for a planet that worked for everyone and
    everything—humans would be "evicted" from "spaceship earth." The Great
    Spirit's experiment would be set back a few million years. He also said that
    god was patient and willing to wait for humans to evolve. Unfortunately, you
    and I do not have the luxury of waiting another million years for our fellow
    humans to "get the message."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Serving More People</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    As stated in the previous chapter, one of the Great Spirit's Generalized
    Principles that Fuller identified was:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    "The more people I serve, the more effective I become."
</p>
<p>
    As part of my own second chance, I do my best to follow this Generalized
    Principle when making business decisions. Rather than just work to make
    myself richer, I began to condition myself to think about how to enrich
    others while I was enriching myself.
</p>
<p>
    That Generalized Principle was instrumental in our decision to sell the
    seminar business that Kim and I founded to our partner. Although that
    seminar business was successful, it was limited in terms of the number of
    people it could serve.
</p>
<p>
    In 1994, it was difficult for us to sell that seminar business, a business
    we loved, were successful in building and making profitable. Yet,
    intuitively, we knew it was time to move on. It was time to seek ways to
    serve more people.
</p>
<p>
    In 1994, we were financially free. That freedom came not from Bucky Fuller's
    lessons, but from following rich dad's lessons. Financial freedom gave us
    the time to develop our next business. In 1996, the first commercial version
    of our CASHFLOW® game was played in Las Vegas and, one week later, in
    Singapore. The next step was to develop a marketing plan to sell that game.
</p>
<p>
    The CASHFLOW game had two inherent problems that made it difficult to sell.
    The first problem was that it was too complex. A game expert we hired
    advised us to "dumb it down" or it would not sell. We decided against that
    recommendation. The CASHFLOW game was designed to be an educational game,
    not a game for entertainment
</p>
<p>
    The second problem with the game was that it was very expensive to produce.
    The same game consultant told us the game should retail for $29.95. At
    $29.95 retail, our cost of manufacturing had to be no more than $7.00 per
    game. Our problem was that the first production run of the game cost over
    $50 per game to produce in China, landed, and warehoused in the United
    States. Against the advice of the game expert, we set the CASHFLOW game's
    retail price at $195, making it one of the most expensive board games on the
    market.
</p>
<p>
    But adversity leads to innovation. To sell the game a $195 game, Kim and I
    had to be innovative. We went to our past seminar clients and offered a
    $500, one day seminar featuring our game. During the seminar, the
    participants played our new game twice. The first time was to get familiar
    with the game. The second time to get into the game. The one-day seminar
    worked. Participants were excited, most claiming they learned more about
    money in one day than they had learned in a lifetime. When we announced the
    "used" games were for sale for $150, they were gone instantly. In fact there
    was a fight for used games, even though there were new games available for
    $195.
</p>
<p>
    The business model worked and the "CASHFLOW Club" concept was born. In 2004,
    The New York Times ran an article, "The Rising Value of Play Money," on
    CASHFLOW Clubs and told us that they had identified over 3,500 clubs—all
    over the world. Many clubs are still in existence today, teaching and
    serving more people than Kim and I could ever do on our own.
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: If you want to serve more people, why didn't you offer the game for
        free?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: We considered using government grants to fund the manufacturing of the
    games, but that would have been following my poor dad's mindset, rather than
    my rich dad's entrepreneurial way of thinking.
</p>
<p>
    Also, giving people things for free often keeps them poor. It encourages the
    "entitlement mentality" that destroys initiative and personal
    responsibility.
</p>
<p>
    In spite of the high initial cost of the game, the online game is free to
    millions of people. One game can and has taught hundreds of people… for
    free, through CASHFLOW Clubs. Many CASHFLOW Club leaders around the world
    support the mission of Rich Dad, which is to elevate the financial well
    being of humanity, and teach the game to others. For them, not only is
    teaching spiritual, but the more they teach, the more they learn.
</p>
<p>
    Most CASHFLOW Club leaders I have talked with report getting back far more
    than they give. They follow the religious principle of "give and you shall
    receive."
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, there are clubs that only present the game to sell other
    products or business opportunities. If you encounter one of those clubs,
    just know that while I support free enterprise, I do not support people
    using my games as marketing tools.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Other Points of View</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    For about six months, I sat in the quaint, artist's town of Bisbee, Arizona…
    in an old jail that had been converted into an apartment. At one time, John
    Wayne owned that old jail, as a rental property. He loved Bisbee—and
    Southern Arizona, where he owned a large ranch.
</p>
<p>
    During the day, I was working on my small ranch, converting an old
    stagecoach depot (a stopping point between Bisbee and the infamous town of
    Tombstone, where the gunfight at the OK Corral took place) into a
    one-bedroom home. At night I would sit in the jail, writing a book. It was a
    painful process. There were many starts and stops, fits and starts. Finally,
    late one night, exhausted from working on my property and tired of
    struggling with a book concept, my fingers began typing the opening lines of
    a new book. It began with the words "I had a rich dad and I had a poor dad."
</p>
<p>
    And that's how the book, Rich Dad Poor Dad, was born. Most people don't know
    that Rich Dad Poor Dad, the book that started the Rich Dad series, was
    written as a "brochure" to market the CASHFLOW game.
</p>
<p>
    On April 8, 1997, my 50th birthday, Rich Dad Poor Dad was launched and The
    Rich Dad Company was born.
</p>
<p>
    Rich Dad Poor Dad floated around in the world of self-published books until
    early in the year 2000. It was selling virally, by word of mouth and one day
    it made The New York Times bestsellers list. It was the only self-published
    book on that prestigious list.
</p>
<p>
    Soon after that, a producer from Oprah Winfrey's TV show called. But before
    she would book me for Oprah, she wanted to talk with rich dad's son. As soon
    as she verified the story of rich dad and poor dad, my guest appearance on
    Oprah was confirmed.
</p>
<p>
    I was in Australia when the invitation came. It was a tough decision: should
    I stay in Australia, or fly to Chicago for the interview. Again the
    principle of "The more people I serve, the more effective I am" kicked in.
    Cutting my trip short, I flew directly from Australia to Chicago. I still
    remember walking onto Oprah's stage, sitting next to her for an hour, and
    talking about the need for financial education
</p>
<p>
    In that hour, my life changed completely. In one hour I went from an unknown
    to a world famous voice for financial education. It had taken only 55 years,
    years of many successes and failures and many second chances, to become an
    overnight success.
</p>
<p>
    I tell you this story, not to brag or pat myself on my back, but as an
    example of the power of following Bucky Fuller's Generalized Principles and
    my rich dad's lessons on money.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>The Rich Are Generous</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    A reporter once asked me if Oprah made me rich. I replied that I was already
    rich the day I stepped on her stage. I was rich financially because I had
    spent my life gaining knowledge, knowledge not taught in schools. All I was
    doing was sharing, being generous with what I knew.
</p>
<p>
    My comment on being generous disturbed the reporter. His view was that a
    person had to be greedy to be rich. When I attempted to explain, the
    generalized principle of unity is plural and, at minimum two—that a person
    could be rich by being greedy and that a person could be rich by being
    generous—his eyes glazed over. His brain was rigidly locked around the idea
    that the only way to become rich was by being greedy. In his mind, it is not
    possible to become rich by being generous. In his mind, there is only one
    kind of rich person: a greedy rich person.
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: What happened after you became famous? Was it smooth sailing after
        that?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: No. Far from it. Fame and money made life harder, not easier. Many
    friends became jealous. Partners became greedy and began to steal. And many
    people came around to see how they could "help." It was tough trying to
    determine if people were coming to truly help with the mission or only to
    "help themselves" to what we had created.
</p>
<p>
    The good news is that over the years many great people have come into our
    lives. Again: Unity is plural and we had to learn to take the good with the
    bad.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Bucky's Last Words</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    As I've said, Fuller died on July 1 in 1983. His wife Anne died 36 hours
    later.
</p>
<p>Both were 87 years old. Even in death, his life was supernatural.</p>
<p>
    He was speaking at an event, which would be his last, when he abruptly
    stopped and sat quietly for a moment. I was not at that event, but I did
    listen to an audiotape of his final words from that event. I will paraphrase
    his final words. Bucky said he was cutting his talk short because his wife
    was gravely ill. He mentioned he'd had a premonition a few days earlier. His
    premonition was that he and his wife were to die together. Realizing death
    was near for both of them, he said "There is something mysterious going on."
    He encouraged everyone to continue on with the work, ending his talk with
    his usual parting words, "Thank you, darling people."
</p>
<p>
    I later learned that he and his wife had made a pact that neither of them
    would ever see the other die. They kept their pact. Rushing to see her,
    Bucky sat at her bedside, where she was in a coma. As if on cue, he put his
    head down next to her, and silently passed on. She followed, 36 hours later,
    keeping their pact to never see the other die. He was a futurist who
    predicted how he and his wife would die. I guess he could hear the Great
    Spirit calling them home.
</p>
<p>
    I was driving on a freeway in Honolulu when the news of their deaths came
    over the radio. The news so overwhelmed me that I pulled over on the side of
    the highway and cried. Looking back, it's clear to me that, as I was sitting
    on the side of the highway that emotional day, one phase of my life had
    ended and another had begun. I was given a new second chance. I was no
    longer to be an entrepreneur in manufacturing. I was about to become an
    entrepreneur in education.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Grunch of Giants</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    A few months later, Bucky's final book, Grunch of Giants, was released
    posthumously. As I've mentioned, GRUNCH stands for Gross Universal Cash
    Heist and refers to how the rich and powerful steal our wealth via our
    money, government, and banking system.
</p>
<p>
    As I read this tiny, yet potent book, many pieces of the puzzle began to
    fall in place. My mind drifted back in time… when I was nine years old, in
    the fourth grade, and I raising my hand to ask my teacher, "When will we
    learn about money?" and "Why are some people rich and most people poor?"

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center">
    "Every child is born a genius, but is swiftly degeniused by unwitting humans
    and/or physically unfavorable environmental factors."
</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>
    "I observe that every child demonstrates a comprehensive curiosity. Children
    are interested in everything and are forever embarrassing their specialized
    parents by the wholeness of their interests. Children demonstrate right from
    the beginning that their genes are organized to help them to apprehend,
    comprehend, coordinate, and employ—in all directions."
</p>
<p>
    Fuller recommended that students take control of their education process. In
    essence: do what Steve Jobs did at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Steve
    Jobs dropped out of school so he could drop back in, studying only subjects
    that interested him. Steve never went back to school.
</p>
<p><i>Q: Did Bucky Fuller say everyone has a genius?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: But I don't feel very smart. I don't think I have a genius. Why is
        that?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: As Bucky says, schools and parents often degenius children. Fuller used
    the metaphor of school being a diamond mine. Teachers dig into the mine
    looking for "diamonds"—the kids they think are geniuses. The "tailings," or
    the dirt and rubble that tossed to the wayside, are the students the
    teachers believe have no genius potential. That is why so many students
    leave school feeling that they're not smart, not bright, not special… even
    angry at school and the school system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: So how does a person find their genius?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: There are many ways. One way is by changing their environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Q: What does environment have to do with my genius?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Let me give you some examples. Many students feel stupid in the
    environment of a classroom, yet their genius comes alive on a football
    field. Tiger Woods' genius comes alive on the golf course. The Beatles'
    genius came alive, with guitars and drums, in a recording studio. Steve Jobs
    dropped out of school, yet his genius came alive in his garage, where he and
    Steve Wozniak developed the first Apple computer.
</p>
<p><i>Q: So why don't I feel smart? Why can't I find my genius?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Because most people go from home to school to work, environments that are
    not always the right environment for their genius to bloom. Many spend their
    lives feeling unfulfilled, untested, unappreciated, simply because they did
    not find the environment in which their genius could blossom.
</p>
<p>
    Think of genius as three words, genie-in-us… the magician in us. The words
    genius, magician, and inspire are all related. Do you know someone who is a
    magician in the kitchen, someone who can take ordinary ingredients and
    create gourmet meals?
</p>
<p><i>Q: Yes.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Do you know someone who has a "green thumb?" Someone who can take dirt,
    water, and seeds and create a magical garden?&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: Sure.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Have you ever watched the Special Olympics, an event for
    physicallychallenged children, and been inspired—spiritually touched—when
    they compete with all their hearts, undaunted and in spite of their
    disabilities and challenges?&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: I have.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Those are examples of "genie-in-us," when the magician in us inspires
    others. We feel inspired when the spirit in someone else touches the spirit
    in us. That is what genius is. When someone inspires us, we're reminded of
    the "geniein-us."
</p>
<p><i>Q: So why don't most people find their genius?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Because being a genius is not easy. For example, someone could be the
    next Tiger Woods, but if that person does not dedicate their life to
    developing their genius, their talents, their genie will never show its
    magic.

<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>More Questions than Answers</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    For me, reading Grunch only raised more questions. And for the first time in
    my life, I wanted to be a student again. I wanted to go back to the fourth
    grade and find the answers to the flurry of questions I kept asking my
    teacher about money. I was hungry to learn, and I wanted answers to my
    questions: "Why is money not a subject taught in school?" and "What makes
    rich people rich?"
</p>
<p>
    As I finished reading Grunch and went on to read Fuller's other books on
    education, I realized my questions in the fourth grade were caused by my
    natural curiosity. Money and why the rich are rich were my subjects of
    study. And, in my opinion, it's not by accident that the subject of money
    had been "sanitized" from academic study.
</p>
<p>
    In 1983, the student in me came alive again and I did exactly as Fuller
    described. The student in me got back to my studies.
</p>
<p>
    Over the years, my own studies verified Fuller's findings that the monetary
    system was designed to steal our wealth, making the rich richer, but not
    making you and I rich. This enslavement of others and theft of another's
    wealth has been going on ever since the first humans walked the earth.
    Fuller believed that intense greed and desire to enslave fellow humans was
    humanity's evolutionary test, a test to see if we could use our hearts and
    minds to create heaven on earth or if we would turn earth into a living hell
    and environmental wasteland.
</p>
<p>
    In Grunch of Giants, Fuller described how the rich and powerful used money,
    banks, government, politicians, military leaders, and the educational system
    to implement their plans. Simply said, money is designed to keep people
    slaves to money and slaves to those who control the monetary system.
</p>
<p>
    Ironically, and although Bucky Fuller and my rich dad would be polar
    opposites on the subject of money, they both would have agreed on the
    concept of money enslaving people. And their polarity supports and validates
    the generalized principle of unity is plural, both men disagreeing on
    substance, but agreeing in principle.

        ><i><strong>The Power of Knowledge</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    Soon after I appeared on Oprah, a mutual fund company offered me $4 million
    to endorse their mutual fund. While I like money as much as the next guy,
    accepting their money would have been selling out to GRUNCH. One of the
    great things about financial education is it gives people the power to
    choose… and to never need to sell their soul for money.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>You and I both knew this was coming…</p>
<p><i>Q: So what can I do?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: The answer is there are many things you can do. The world is filled with
    problems. A better question might be: What problem do you want to solve?
    What problem do you think god gave you unique gifts to solve? You can do it
    by yourself or you can join a group or an organization in solving the
    problem that causes you concern.
</p>
<p>
    When you look at the world from the point of view of problems to solve, you
    will see that there is a lot to do and a lot you can do
</p>
<p>
    A more important question is: Are you willing to work on solving the
    problem? Or are you willing to work only if someone will pay you money?
</p>
<p>
    In the next chapter, you will learn what I learned while looking for the
    answer of how our wealth is stolen via our money system and why there is no
    financial education in our schools.
</p>
<p>
    By creating the CASHFLOW board game and writing Rich Dad Poor Dad, our
    wealth, income, and recognition went up exponentially. I mention this for
    those of you who are wondering when I will get around to what you can do for
    your second chance in life.
</p>
<p>
    For those of you considering a second chance with your money and your life,
    you may want to ask yourself:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">"How can I serve more people?"</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;rather than:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">"How can I make more money?"</p>
<p>
    If you ask yourself how you can serve more people—rather than simply make
    more money—you are following one of the Generalized Principles of god.
</p>
