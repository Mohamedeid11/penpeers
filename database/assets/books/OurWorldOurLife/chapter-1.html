    "They're playing games with money… Our wealth is stolen via the money we
    work for." – R. Buckminster Fuller
</p>
<hr />
<p>
    Rich Dad Poor Dad was self-published in 1997. It had to be a self-published
    book because every major publisher we pitched it to turned it down. A few
    publishers commented, "You don't know what you are talking about."
</p>
<p>
    Some of the points they objected to were my rich dad's statements such as:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Your house is not an asset.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Savers are losers.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>The rich don't work for money</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>
    Ten years later, in 2007, the subprime mortgage crisis hit and millions of
    homeowners found out—first hand—that their house is not an asset.
</p>
<p>
    In 2008, the U.S. government and Federal Reserve Bank began printing
    trillions of dollars, causing millions of savers to be losers via the loss
    of purchasing power due to inflation, higher taxes, and low interest rates
    on their savings.

<p>
    Rich Dad's Lesson One in Rich Dad Poor Dad is The Rich Don't Work for Money…
    and it was the least criticized of rich dad's three teachings on money. In
    this chapter, you will learn why this comment is the most important of my
    rich dad's lessons, and why it is important to understand before you
    consider your opportunities for a second chance, a fresh start for both your
    money and your life.

        ><i><strong>What You Need to Know About Money</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    The subject of money can be complicated and intimidating. But if you start
    with the basics and use them as building blocks you can gain the knowledge
    you need to understand money and investing and how to make your money work
    for you.
</p>
<p>
    The most basic thing you need to know about money is that it is a subject
    that you can become smarter about, a subject that can give you the
    confidence to make informed and educated decisions.
</p>
<p><i>Q: Who needs a second chance?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: We all do.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Q: Why?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: Because money—as we know it—has changed and continues to change.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Q: Why is that important?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Because the poor will become poorer, the middle class will shrink, and
    the rich will get richer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: I think we all know that. What is different about the rich getting
        richer and everyone else becoming poorer?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>A: Many people who are rich today will be among the new poor.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Q: Why will the rich become the new poor?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: There are many reasons. One reason is because many rich people measure
    their wealth in money.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: What's wrong with that?</i></p>
<p><i>A: The fact that money is no longer money.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>Q: If money is no longer money, then what is money?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: Knowledge is the new money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: So if money is knowledge, you're saying that many who are poor and
        middle class today, have the opportunity to become the new rich of
        tomorrow?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: Exactly. In the past, the rich were those who controlled land and
    resources such as oil, weapons, or giant corporations. Today things are
    different. Today we live in the Information Age—and information is abundant
    and often free.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: So why isn't everyone rich?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: It takes education to process information into knowledge. Without
    financial education, people cannot process information into personal
    wealth.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: But America spends billions on education. Why are there more poor
        people than rich people?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: Hundreds of billions of dollars are spent on education, but almost
    nothing is spent on financial education.
</p>
<p><i>Q: Why isn't financial education taught in schools?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: I have been asking that question for years, ever since I was nine years
    old.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: And what did you find out?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: I learned that knowledge is power. If you want to control people's lives,
    limit their knowledge. That is why, throughout history, despots have burned
    books and exiled (and even killed) those with knowledge who threatened their
    power. Before the Civil War in America, it was against the law in many
    states to teach slaves to read and write. Knowledge is the most powerful
    force on earth. That is why the control of knowledge is essential to the
    control of power.
</p>
<p>The formula is:</p>
<p>Information x Education = Knowledge</p>
<p>Knowledge is power—and lack of knowledge is weakness.</p>
<p>
    My poor dad was a highly educated man with a PhD, but he had almost no
    financial education. He had authority within the school system, but little
    power in the real world.
</p>
<p>
    My rich dad never finished school, but he was highly educated in the world
    of money. Although less formally educated than my poor dad, he had more
    power in the real world than my poor dad.
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: So those in power maintain control of that power through the school
        system… through what's taught—and what isn't taught. That's why there is
        no financial education in schools?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: I believe that's true. Today financial knowledge is more powerful than a
    gun or the whips and shackles of slavery. The lack of financial education
    enslaves billions of people in all parts of the world.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: What has replaced the whips and shackles and guns?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: The monetary system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: The monetary system? Our money? How does the monetary system control
        people?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: The money system is designed to keep people poor, not to make them rich.
    The monetary system is designed to keep people working hard for money. Money
    enslaves those who are uneducated financially. Those who are financially
    uneducated become slaves to a paycheck. And our wealth is stolen through
    money, through the very thing most people work for all their lives. That is
    why the people who work the hardest for money, often called the "working
    poor," continue to grow poorer, not richer, no matter how hard they work.
</p>
<p><i>Q: How is our wealth stolen via our money?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: There are many ways. You may already know some of them.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Taxes:</strong> The value of your labor is stolen via taxes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Inflation:</strong> Prices rise when governments print money. As
        prices rise, people work harder, only to pay more in taxes and
        inflation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Savings:</strong> The banks steal savers' wealth via a banking
        process known as the fractional reserve system. Let's use a fractional
        reserve of 10, as an example. A saver puts $1 into his or her savings
        account. The bank is allowed to lend $10, against that $1, to borrowers.
        This is another form of "printing money" which is not only inflationary
        but reduces the purchasing power of a saver's money. This is one of a
        number of reasons why rich dad often said, "Savers are losers."
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Later in this book I will explain other ways in which your money is stolen
    from you. As I've said: The monetary system was designed to make people
    poorer, not richer.
</p>
<p><i>Q: Can you prove that?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: I will show you a graph. As the saying goes, 'A picture is worth a
    thousand words.' The graph is not proof, but it does tell a story about the
    growth of people needing government assistance.

        ><i><strong>The War on Poverty</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson declared a war on poverty. Many believe we
    won that war. Others do not. The chart below shows the numbers of people who
    use "food stamps," today called SNAP: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
    Program. Although many believe we won the war on poverty, the increasing
    reliance on food stamps tells a different story.

    The chart of individuals receiving food stamps shows that, in 1975,
    approximately 17 million people received food stamps. By 2013, the number
    had increased to approximately 47 million people and continues to increase.

<p>The chart above shows what's happening to the middle class.</p>
<p>
    A few years ago, TV journalist Lou Dobbs wrote a book on this middle class
    decline, The War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big Business, and
    Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the American Dream and How to
    Fight Back. His point: If the middle class is in decline, the United States
    is in decline, since the middle class is the engine of the U.S. economy.
</p>
<p>
    During the 2012 Presidential campaign, both candidates Barack Obama and Mitt
    Romney promised to save the middle class. An inquiring mind might ask, "Why
    does the middle class need saving?" As most of us know, if the government is
    promising to save you, you have already lost.

<p><i>Q: How does the monetary system cause inflation?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: The primary cause of inflation is the printing of money. When money is
    printed—by banks or governments—two things happen: inflation kicks in and
    taxes goes up. When prices and taxes go up, people struggle
    financially.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: How do people survive when prices go up?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: When prices go up, people use their credit cards to survive. Many are
    forced to cut expenses… like healthier food or dental care. Many become
    slaves to debt. And many more become little more than indentured servants,
    or slaves to their paychecks.

</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: How are the rich getting richer, if the poor and middle class are
        growing poorer?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: There are two types of rich people. One type of rich is the truly rich.
    They are getting richer. The other type of rich is getting poorer. The chart
    on the next page tells that story.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: I can see that the rich, the upper 1%, are getting richer. But what
        is happening to the 90-95%? Why is their income going down? Are those
        the rich that you're talking about, the rich that are growing
        poorer?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: Yes. This chart tells a tale of two different types of rich people. As
    you can see from the chart, the real rich, the top 1% of all Americans,
    became extremely rich—with a gain of 309% in income since 1979.
</p>
<p>Yet, the top 95-99% are losing ground. Their income is not growing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: Is this why you said earlier about some of the rich becoming the new
        poor?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: Yes. Notice the chart we just looked at only takes us to 2007. That was
    the year the Great Recession began. After 2007, many millionaires were wiped
    out in the subprime mortgage fiasco and the stock market crash.

<p><i>Q: So this chart would look worse today?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Yes. The upper 1% of Americans has gotten richer. Many of the others, the
    other type of rich I've described, are now poorer. Many slid from rich to
    poor in less than a year. Many were wiped out when they lost their
    high-paying jobs, their homes, and their wealth as stock portfolios
    collapsed. Of the rich who survived the crash and remain in the upper 20%,
    many (thanks to inflation) are becoming poorer. Some have already slid into
    the middle class.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: Tell me again… what's the difference between the two types of
        rich?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: One type of rich is people with high-paying jobs, such as corporate
    executives, professional people such as doctors and lawyers, athletes, and
    movie stars. They are high-income rich. The other type of rich is the person
    who does not need a job to be rich. Most of these people are asset-rich.

        ><i><strong>The Millionaire Next Door</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    In 1996, The Millionaire Next Door was published. It was a great book for
    its time. Written by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko, the book
    described how ordinary, middle-class citizens had become millionaires. They
    did it without being Donald Trump, Steve Jobs, or Gordon Gekko from the
    movie Wall Street. They were not millionaire movie stars, rock stars, or
    professional athletes. They had become middle-class millionaires by having a
    good education, living in a modest home in an upscale neighborhood, driving
    sensible cars, saving money, and investing steadily in the stock market.
</p>
<p>
    Many were "net-worth millionaires," people who had become rich as a result
    of the rising value on their homes and retirement portfolios. They had
    become middle-class millionaires through inflation, by being part of the
    rising U.S. economy. They were living proof of the American Dream.
</p>
<p>
    The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks signaled the start of the new
    millennium and end of the American Dream.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The chart below shows that, since 9/11, life for the millionaire-next-door
    has not been easy.

    Prior to 2007, housing prices had been rising steadily for years. As home
    prices rose, millions of homeowners began taking out "home-equity loans,"
    which many used to pay off credit card debt or go on vacation. Using their
    homes as ATMs… they learned the hard way—when they were upside down—that
    their "house is not an asset."
</p>
<p>
    When housing prices crashed, credit card use went down. When homeowners
    stopped using their credit cards, the economy slowed because the economy
    depends upon consumer spending and use of their credit cards. When consumers
    slowed their spending, retailers began to suffer, and when retailers suffer
    the world economy suffers.
</p>
<p>
    Today, in 2014, there are approximately 115 million households in the United
    States. Of those 115 million households, 43 million are renters and 25
    million are households or families who own their homes free and clear. Of
    the approximately 50 million households with mortgages, it's estimated that
    over 24 million are "underwater," which means they owe more on their home
    than their home is worth.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>As long as homeowners feel poor, the economy will suffer.</p>

        ><i><strong>The Lost Generation</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    When the middle-class millionaires-next-door lost their jobs and their
    homes, and began using retirement accounts to pay the bills, there was
    another casualty: The children of the millionaire-next-door.
</p>
<p>
    All over the world, there is a generation of young people known as the new
    lost generation. They're the college and trade school and high school grads
    who cannot find jobs or jobs that utilize their level of education. More
    than income, they are losing crucial real-life work experience. Without
    real-life work experience in their 20s and 30s, their earning power and
    income in later years will suffer, which is why they're often called the
    lost generation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Young, Educated, and in Debt</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    Many of these highly educated people graduate saddled with student-loan
    debt, quite possibly the worst of all possible debt. Unlike a car loan, home
    loan, or business loan, student loan debt is rarely forgiven. A student
    cannot declare bankruptcy and expect to be released from the loan. Student
    loan debt is an albatross around the neck of a student for life, accruing
    interest for life. Many will have problems buying a car, home, or investing
    for their future until their student loan debt is paid off. The current
    overhaul of the student loan programs may address these issues and
    challenges.
</p>
<p>
    Many of these young people are boomerang kids, kids who leave home, only to
    return to live with mom and dad. This makes many moms and dads, the sandwich
    generation, people who are now caring for their kids and their parents,
    often with three generations living under one roof.
</p>
<p>
    Other countries offer free higher education. In America, we create debt
    slaves out of our students.
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: Is this why you say everyone needs a second chance? Because some of
        the rich are becoming poor, the middle class is shrinking, poverty is
        increasing, and our students are highly educated, underemployed, and
        deep in debt?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: Yes. The world is changing and money is changing. Those who are operating
    in the past, with the old-world rules of money, are being wiped out in the
    present.
</p>
<p>
    We live in the Information Age. There is an abundance of information, and
    much of it's free. But without financial education, a person cannot convert
    that information into knowledge.
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: And if knowledge is power, then millions are highly educated but
        without much power. Is that why millions of people need a second chance…
        to get their power back? </i
    >A: Yes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: The Millionaire Next Door was published in 1996. Rich Dad Poor Dad
        was published in 1997. What was the difference between the two
        books?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: The Millionaire Next Door was about net-worth millionaires. Rich Dad Poor
    Dad was about cash-flow millionaires.
</p>
<p><i>Q: There's a difference?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: A very big differences. Many net worth millionaires were counting their
    liabilities, such as their home and their car, as assets. When the real
    estate and stock markets crashed, many net-worth millionaires were wiped out
    as the value of their liabilities crashed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Many cash-flow millionaires, millionaires who receive their income from real
    assets, got richer. They got richer buying the liabilities of the net-worth
    millionaires at bargain-basement prices.
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: So without financial education, millions do not understand the
        difference between the different types of rich people?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: That is correct. There are many different ways a person can achieve great
    wealth. For example, a person can inherit wealth or marry into wealth. As
    Warren Buffett often says, "There are many ways of getting into financial
    heaven."
</p>
<p>
    Since my poor dad was poor, a man without assets, I had no wealth to
    inherit. Nor did I want to marry for money. At an early age, I decided I
    would gain my wealth my rich dad's way—via financial education and acquiring
    assets.
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: So… without financial education, most people don't know the
        difference between assets and liabilities. So their wealth is stolen via
        a lack of financial education. Is that what you're saying?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: Yes. If a person knew the simple definitions of basic financial words,
    their wealth would increase. The good news is that words are free.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-big"
        ><i><strong>Past, Present, and Future</strong></i></span
    >
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: And that is why millions of educated, hard-working people are losing
        their wealth? They have become educated slaves to money, much like the
        uneducated slaves before the Civil War. Is that what you are
        saying?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: Yes. Education—or the lack of education—is one of the keys on the key
    ring of those in power.
</p>
<p><i>Q: What is happening to those in power?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: The Information Age is causing those in power to lose power. That's why
    your personal financial education is more important today than at any other
    time in history. Desperate people in power are doing desperate things to
    hold on to their illusion of power.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: What do you see in the future?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Once again, pictures are more powerful than words. I will show you a few
    pictures, add a few words, and let you decide what the future holds

    The Great Depression, when measured against the Dow, lasted 25 years, from
    1929 to 1954. In 1929, the Dow hit an all-time high of 381. It took 25 years
    for it to reach 381 again. This is an alternative point of view, as there
    are those who believe it ended in 1939.
</p>
<p><i>Q: Could we be entering a New Depression?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Yes. Many people already are in their own New Depression. That's why food
    stamp use is up, the middle class is shrinking, students who are loaded with
    student-loan debt can't find jobs, and many of yesterday's
    millionaires-next-door are broke. On top of this we have the first of
    approximately 76 million American baby boomers retiring. Many, if not most,
    of these aging baby boomers don't have enough money to retire. Advances in
    healthcare and medicine may mean these baby boomers will live longer, while
    the cost of healthcare is likely to continue increasing, as is the cost of
    food, fuel, and housing.

<p>
    A: It means different things to different people. If you are young, it means
    you'd better not count on the government to take care of you. If you are a
    baby boomer, it means the money you paid into the Social Security fund is
    gone. If you are of the World War II generation, your timing was good.

<p><i>Q: What story does this chart tell?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Again, it depends upon who you ask. For most people, and the average
    American, it means nothing. Without financial education, most Americans are
    clueless. This chart has very little meaning to them. Today the national
    debt tops $17 trillion. To some people it means the end is near. And to a
    few, it points to the opportunity of a lifetime.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: What does it mean to you?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: While I empathize with the first two groups, I am in the third group.
    Although I'm a bit fearful and very concerned for those who will be hurt, I
    view the future with excitement, excited to be a witness to the biggest
    power shift and transfer of wealth in the history of the world. It is the
    dawn of a new age. If the change is managed well, many of humanity's
    shackles will be thrown off and we will enter an age of sustainable
    prosperity for all. If things do not go well, and those in power today win
    using violence to retain control of their power, we may enter a New Dark
    Age.
</p>
<p><i>Q: What will make the difference?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Many things will play a role… such as technology and the rise of China as
    a world power. Yet the big shift must come in education, not only in what we
    teach and but how we teach.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: What do you think the chances are? Do you think education will
        change?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: No. Not in the near future. A case could be made to support the position
    that those who control the monetary system also control the educational
    system. That is why I became an educational entrepreneur back in 1984. That
    is why I write my books and create financial education games outside the
    school system. Today I am a hybrid, an entrepreneur like my rich dad and an
    educator like my poor dad.
</p>
<p>
    As you may know, I believe in personal responsibility. I believe in changing
    the things we have the ability to change and control. Each of us has the
    power to change ourselves. And the easiest—and often most powerful—change we
    can make is through education.
</p>
<p><i>Q: What do you see in the future?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: To see the future you must study the past. As the saying goes, "Those who
    do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it."
</p>
<p>In the past, there were two different types of Depressions:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>The American Depression (1929 to 1954)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>The German Hyper-Inflation (1918 to 1924)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Q: What was the difference?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: In very simple terms, Americans did not print money and the Germans
    printed money.
</p>
<p>Pictured here is what happened when Germany began printing money.</p>

    The picture above shows what happens when a central bank and a government
    print money to pay their bills.
</p>
<p>
    In 1918, a German citizen could be a "millionaire" by having millions of
    German Reischmarks in savings. In less than five years, that same German
    millionaire was poor.
</p>
<p><i>Q: Is the same thing happening in the United States today?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: Yes.</p>

<p>The following is a chart on QE, Quantitative Easing.</p>
<p><i>Q: What does this mean?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: It means the United States is following the German model from the last
    Depression. America is attempting to "print" its way out of financial
    crisis.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: What does this mean to me?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: It means exactly what I stated earlier in this chapter. It means your
    wealth is being stolen via the money you work so hard for. As I said, the
    monetary system was not designed to make you rich. Money was designed as a
    means to steal your wealth.
</p>
<p>
    Look at the chart below. It shows what has happened to the purchasing power
    of your money.

    It has taken about 100 years for the dollar to lose 95% of its purchasing
    power. I doubt it will take another 100 years to lose the last 5%.
</p>
<p><i>Q: Are you saying the dollar will go to zero?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: If the United States keeps printing money, it might.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Q: But it can't happen in America, can it?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: It has happened a number of times.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Q: When?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: During the Revolutionary War, President George Washington and the
    Congress of the United States began printing a currency known as the
    Continental to pay for the war. The British helped destroy the Continental
    by printing bogus Continentals. Soon the Continental was worth less than the
    paper it was printed on. During the Revolutionary War, "Not worth a
    Continental" was the slogan of the war.
</p>
<p>
    The same thing happened to the Confederate dollar. The Confederacy printed
    money to pay its bills and buy weapons. In many ways, the Civil War was lost
    because of "bad money."
</p>
<p>
    The U.S. government printed the "greenback" to pay for the Civil War. If the
    North had lost, the "greenback" would have followed the Confederate dollar
    into the trash can.
</p>
<p>
    Today, if the U.S. government keeps printing today's "greenbacks," they,
    too, may be as worthless as the Continental and Confederate dollars.
</p>
<p><i>Q: What happens if the dollar goes to zero?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: It means savers will be the biggest losers and those who work for money
    will have lost the battle. Their wealth will be gone. I always remind myself
    that a German person could be a millionaire in 1918 and wiped out by 1923.
    And that's why Lesson One in Rich Dad Poor Dad is The Rich Don't Work for
    Money.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Q: If the rich don't work for money, what do the rich work for?&nbsp;</i>
</p>
<p>
    A: That is what this book—and most of my books and games—are. Many people
    need a second chance to rethink about what they work for.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: What do I need to learn?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: We will start with the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Q: Why the past?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Because it's from the past that we can see the future. From the past, you
    will learn how the rich and powerful steal our wealth via our money.
</p>
<p>
    In the following chapters, you will learn how the rich and powerful have
    ripped us off via a Cash Heist. If you understand how the Cash Heist works,
    you will have a better chance to make smarter choices in the present for a
    more prosperous and secure future.
</p>
<p><i>Q: Will everyone have a prosperous and secure future?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>A: No, unfortunately. I'm afraid not.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Q: Why?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: Because most people are still in the past. If they are stuck in the past,
    they will not understand Rich Dad's Lesson One… The Rich Don't Work for
    Money.
</p>
<p>
    Today, most people are too busy working for money, working hard to pay bills
    and save enough for the future. They will not understand Lesson One unless
    they are willing to take the time to first understand the past.
</p>
<p>
    A second chance will do little good for people stuck in the past. As the
    saying goes, "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and
    over and expecting different results." When it comes to money, many people
    are insane.
</p>
<p>
    Since we must start with the past to see the future, are you ready to move
    into the past? If your answer was "Yes" please read on.
</p>
<p>
    <i
        >Q: One last question: If money was designed to make people poor, to
        steal their wealth, then whom does money make rich?&nbsp;</i
    >
</p>
<p>
    A: The rich… the rich who do not work for money… the rich who control the
    game of money.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><i>Q: How long has the game been going on?&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
    A: The game of money has been going on for as long as humans have walked the
    earth. Humans have always wanted to enslave others or take what others have.
    It's not a new game. The rich have been playing the game for a very long
    time.
</p>
<p>
    If it is your turn to learn the game of money, the game the rich play, then
    this is your second chance.
