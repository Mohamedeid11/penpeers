    The strange and unnatural storm laid siege to all of Ansalon. Lightning<br />walked
    the land; gigantic, ground-shaking warriors who hurled bolts of fire.<br />Ancient
    trees-huge oaks that had withstood both Cataclysms-burst into flame<br />and
    were reduced to smoldering ruin in an instant. Whirlwinds raged behind
    the<br />thundering warriors, ripping apart homes, flinging boards, brick,
    and stone and<br />mortar into the air with lethal aban-Idon. Torrential
    cloudbursts caused rivers to<br />swell and overflow their banks, washing
    away the young green shoots of grain<br />struggling up from the darkness to
    bask in the early summer sun.<br />In Sanction, besieger and besieged alike
    abandoned the ongo-ing struggle to<br />seek refuge from the terrible storm.
    Ships on the .. high seas tried to ride it out,<br />with the result that
    some went under, never to be seen or heard from again.<br />Others would
    later limp home with jury-rigged masts, telling tales of sailors<br />swept
    over-board, the pumps at work day and night.<br />In Palanthas, innumerable
    cracks appeared in the roof of the Great Library.<br />The rain poured
    inside, sending Bertrem and the monks into a mad scramble to<br />staunch
    the flow, mop the floor and move precious volumes to safety. In Tarsis,<br />the
    rain was so heavy that the sea which had vanished during the Cataclysm<br />returned,
    to the wonder and astonishment of all inhabitants. The sea was gone a<br />few
    days later, leaving behind gasping fish and an ungodly smell.<br />The storm
    struck the island of Schallsea a particularly devastating blow. The<br />winds
    blew out every single window in the Cozy Hearth. Ships that rode at<br />anchor
    in the harbor were dashed against the cliffs or smashed into the docks. A<br />tidal
    surge washed away many buildings and homes built near the shoreline.<br />Countless
    people died, countless others were left homeless. Refugees stormed<br />the
    Citadel of Light, pleading for the mystics to come to their aid.<br />The
    Citadel was a beacon of hope in Krynn’s dark night. &nbsp;Trying to fill
    the<br />void left by the absence of the gods, Goldmoon had discovered the
    mystical<br />power of the heart, had brought healing back to the world. She
    was living proof<br />that although Pal-adine and Mishakal were gone, their
    power for good lived on<br />in the hearts of those who had loved them.<br />Yet
    Goldmoon was growing old. The memories of the gods were fading.<br />And so,
    it seemed, was the power of the heart. One after another, the mystics
    felt<br />their power recede, a tide that went out but never returned. Still
    the mystics of<br />the Citadel were glad to open their doors and their
    hearts to the storm’s victims,<br />provide shelter and succor, and work to
    heal the injured as best they could.<br />Solamnic Knights, who had
    established a fortress on Schallsea, rode forth to<br />do battle with the
    storm-one of the most fearsome enemies these valiant Knights<br />had ever
    faced. At risk of their own lives, the Knights plucked people from the<br />raging
    water and dragged them from beneath smashed buildings, working in the<br />wind
    and rain and lightning-shattered darkness to save the lives of those they<br />were
    sworn by Oath and Measure to protect.<br />The Citadel of Light withstood
    the storm’s rage, although its buildings were<br />buffeted by fierce winds
    and lancing rain. As if in a last ditch attempt to make its<br />wrath felt,
    the storm hurled hailstones the size of a man’s head upon the citadel’s<br />crystal
    walls. &nbsp;Everywhere the hailstones struck, tiny cracks appeared in
    the<br />crystalline walls. Rainwater seeped through these cracks, trickled
    like tears down<br />the walls.<br />One particularly loud crash came from
    the vicinity of the chambers of<br />Goldmoon, founder and mistress of the
    Citadel. The mystics heard the sound of<br />breaking glass and ran in fear
    to see if the elderly woman was safe. To their<br />astonishment, they found
    the door to her rooms locked. They beat upon it, called<br />upon her to let
    them inside.<br />A voice, low and awful to hear, a voice that was
    Goldmoon’s beloved voice<br />and yet was not, ordered them to leave her in
    peace, to go about their duties.<br />Others needed their aid, she said.
    &nbsp;She did not. Baffled, uneasy, most did as they<br />were told. Those
    who lingered behind reported hearing the sound of sobbing,<br />heartbroken
    and despairing.<br />“She, too, has lost her power,lI said those outside her
    door.<br />Thinking that they understood, they left her alone.<br />When
    morning finally came and the sun rose to shine a lurid red in the sky,<br />people
    stood about in dazed horror, looking upon the destruction wrought during<br />the
    terrible night. The mystics went to Goldmoon’s chamber to ask for her<br />counsel,
    but no answer came. The door to Goldmoon’s chamber remained closed<br />and
    barred.

    /><br />The storm also swept through Qualinesti, another elven kingdom, but
    one<br />that was separated from its cousins by dis-. &nbsp;tance that could
    be measured both in<br />hundreds of miles and in ancient hatred and
    distrust. In Qualinesti, whirling<br />winds up-rooted giant trees and flung
    them about like the slender sticks used in<br />Quin Thalasi, a popular
    elven game. The storm shook the fabled Tower of the<br />Speaker of the Sun
    on its foundation, sent the beautiful stained glass of its<br />storied
    windows raining down upon the floor. Rising water flooded the lower<br />chambers
    of the newly constructed fortress of the Dark Knights at Newport,<br />forcing
    them to do what an enemy army could not-abandon their posts.<br />The storm
    woke even the great dragons, slumbering, bloated and fat, in their<br />lairs
    that were rich with tribute. The storm shook the Peak of Malys, lair of<br />Malystrx,
    the enormous red dragon who now fashioned herself the Queen of<br />Ansalon,
    soon to become Goddess of Ansalon, if she had her way. The rain<br />formed
    rushing rivers that invaded Malys’s volcanic home. Rainwater flowed<br />into
    the lava pools, creating enormous clouds of a noxious-smelling steam that<br />filled
    the corridors and halls. Wet, half-blind, choking in the fumes, Malys<br />roared
    her indignation and flew from lair to lair, trying to find one that was
    dry<br />enough for her to return to sleep.<br />Finally she was driven to
    seek the lower levels of her mountain home. Malys<br />was an ancient dragon
    with a malevolent wisdom. She sensed something<br />unnatural about this
    storm, and it made her uneasy. Grumbling and muttering to<br />herself, she
    entered the Chamber of the Totem. Here, on an outcropping of black<br />rock,
    Malys had piled the skulls of all the lesser dragons she had consumed<br />when
    she first came to the world. Silver skulls and gold, red skulls and blue<br />stood
    one atop the other, a monument to her greatness. Malys was comforted by<br />the
    sight of the skulls. &nbsp;Each brought a memory of a battle won, a foe
    defeated<br />and de-voured. The rain could not penetrate this far down in
    her mountain home.<br />She could not hear the wind howl. The flashes of
    lightning did not disturb her<br />slumbers.<br />Malys gazed ~pon the empty
    eyes of the skulls with pleasure, and perhaps<br />she dozed, because
    suddenly it seemed to her that the eyes of skulls were alive<br />and they
    were watching her. She snorted, reared her head. She stared closely at<br />the
    skulls, at the eyes. The lava pool at the heart of the mountain cast a
    lurid<br />light upon the skulls, sent shadows winking and blinking in the
    empty eye<br />sockets. Berating herself for an overactive imagination,
    Malys coiled her body<br />comfortably around the totem and fell asleep.<br />Another
    of the great dragons, a Green known grandiosely as Beryllinthranox<br />was
    also not able to sleep through the storm. &nbsp;Beryl’s lair was formed of
    living<br />trees-ironwoods and redwoods-and enormous, twining vines. The
    vines and<br />branches of the trees were so thickly interwoven that no
    raindrop had ever<br />managed to wriggle its way through. But the rain that
    fell from the roiling black<br />clouds of this storm seemed to make it a
    personal mission to find a way to<br />penetrate the leaves. Once one had
    managed to sneak inside, it opened the way<br />for thousands of its
    fellows. Beryl woke in surprise at the unaccustomed feel of<br />water
    splashing on her nose. One of the great redwoods that formed a pillar of<br />her
    lair was struck by a lightning bolt. The tree burst into flames, flames
    that<br />spread quickly, feeding on rainwater as if it were lamp oil.<br />Beryl’s
    roar of alarm brought her minions scrambling to douse the flames.<br />Dragons,
    Reds and Blues who had joined Beryl rather than be consumed by her,<br />dared
    the flames to pluck out the burning trees and cast them into the sea.<br />Draconians
    pulled down blazing vines, smothered the flames with dirt and mud.<br />Hostages
    and prisoners were put to work fighting the fires. Many died doing so,<br />but
    eventually Beryl’s lair was saved. She was in a terrible humor for days<br />afterward,
    however, convincing herself that the storm had been an attack waged<br />magically
    by her cousin Malys. Beryl meant to rule someday in Malys’s stead.<br />Using
    her magic to rebuild-a magical power that had lately been dwindling,<br />something
    else Beryl blamed on Malys-the Green nursed her wrongs and plotted<br />revenge.<br />Khellendros
    the Blue (he had abandoned the name Skie for this more<br />magnificent
    title, which meant Storm over Ansalon), was one of the few of the<br />dragons
    native to Krynn to have emerged from the Dragon Purge. He was now<br />ruler
    of Solamnia and all its environs. He was overseer of Schallsea and the<br />Citadel
    of Light, which he allowed to remain because-according to him-he found<br />it
    amusing to watch the petty humans struggle futilely against the growing<br />darkness.
    In truth, the real reason he permitted the citadel to thrive in safety
    was<br />the citadel’s guardian, a silver dragon named Mirror. Mirror and
    Skie were<br />longtime foes and now, in their mutual detestation of the
    new, great dragons<br />from afar who had killed so many of their brethren,
    they had become not friends,<br />but not quite enemies either.<br />Khellendros
    was bothered by the storm far more than either of the great<br />dragons,
    although-strangely enough-the storm did not do his lair much damage.<br />He
    paced restively about his enormous cave high in the Vingaard mountains,<br />watched
    the lightning warriors strike viciously at the ramparts of the High<br />Clerist’s
    Tower, and he thought he heard a voice in the wind, a voice that sang of<br />death.
    Khellendros did not sleep but watched the storm to its end.<br />The storm
    lost none of its power as it roared down upon the ancient elven<br />kingdom
    of Silvanesti. The elves had erected a magical shield over their<br />kingdom,
    a shield that had thus far kept the marauding dragons from conquering<br />their
    lands, a shield that also kept out all other races. The elves had finally<br />succeeded
    in their historic goal of isolating themselves from the troubles of the<br />rest
    of the world. But the shield did not keep out the thunder and rain, wind
    and<br />lightning.
