<p>
    In the old days, the glory days, before the War of the Lance, the road that
    led<br />from Neraka to the port city of Sanction had been well maintained,
    for that road<br />was the only route through the mountains known as the
    Lords of Doom. The<br />road-known as the Hundred Mile Road, for it was
    almost one hundred miles<br />long, give or take a furlong or two-was paved
    with crushed rock. Thousands of<br />feet had marched over the crushed rock
    during the intervening years; booted<br />human feet, hairy goblin feet,
    clawed draconian feet. So many thousand that the<br />rock had been pounded
    into the ground and was now deeply embedded.<br />During the height of the
    War of the Lance, the Hundred Mile Road had been<br />clogged with men,
    beasts, and supply wagons. &nbsp;Anyone who had need of speed<br />took to
    the air, riding on the backs of the swift-flying blue dragons or
    traversing<br />the skies in floating citadels. Those forced to move along
    the road could be<br />delayed for days, blocked by the hundreds of foot
    soldiers who slogged along its<br />torturous route, either marching to the
    city of Neraka or marching away from it.<br />Wagons lurched and jolted
    along the road. The grade was steep, descending<br />from the high mountain
    valley all the way to sea level, making the journey a<br />perilous one.<br />Wagons
    loaded with gold, silver, and steel, boxes of stolen jewels, booty<br />looted
    from people the armies had conquered, were hauled by fearsome beasts<br />known
    as mammoths, the only creatures strong enough to drag the heavily laden<br />wagons
    up the mountain road. Occasionally one of the wagons would tip over<br />and
    spill its contents or lose a wheel, or one of the mammoths would run
    berserk<br />and trample its keepers and anyone else unfortunate enough to
    be in its path. At<br />these times, the road was shut down completely,
    bringing everything to a halt<br />while officers tried to keep their men in
    order and fumed and fretted at the delay.<br />The mammoths were gone, died
    out. The men were gone too. &nbsp;Most of them<br />now old. Some of them
    now dead. All of them now forgotten. The road was<br />empty, deserted. Only
    the wind’s whistling breath blew across the road, which,<br />with its
    smooth, inlaid gravel surface, was considered one of the man-made<br />wonders
    of Krynn.<br />The wind was at the backs of the Dark Knights as they
    galloped down the<br />winding, twisting snake’s back that was the Hundred
    Mile Road. The wind, a<br />remnant of the storm, howled among the mountain
    tops, an echo of the Song of<br />Death they had heard in Neraka, but only
    an echo, not as terrible, not as<br />frightening. The Knights rode hard,
    rode in a daze, rode without any clear idea<br />of why they rode or where
    they were heading. They rode in an ecstasy, an<br />excitement that was
    unlike anything they had ever before experienced.<br />Certainly Galdar had
    felt nothing like it. He loped along at Mina’s side,<br />running with
    new-found strength. He could have run from here to Ice Wall<br />without
    pause. He might have credited his energy to pure joy at regaining his<br />severed
    limb, but he saw his awe and fervor reflected in the faces of the men<br />who
    made that exhilarating, mad dash alongside him. It was as if they brought<br />the
    storm with them-hooves thundering among the mountain walls, the iron<br />shoes
    of the horses striking lightning bolts from the rock surface.<br />Mina rode
    at their head, urging them on when they would have stopped from<br />fatigue,
    forcing them to look into themselves to find just a bit more strength
    than<br />they knew they possessed. &nbsp;They rode through the night, their
    way lit by<br />lightning flashes. &nbsp;They rode through the day, halting
    only to water the horses<br />and eat a quick bite standing.<br />When it
    seemed the horses must founder, Mina called a halt. &nbsp;The Knights<br />had
    traversed well over half the distance. As it was, her own roan, Foxfire,
    could<br />have continued on. He appeared to actually resent the stop, for
    the horse stamped<br />and snorted in dis-pleasure, his irritated protests
    splitting the air and bouncing<br />back from the mountain tops.<br />Foxfire
    was fiercely loyal to his mistress and to her alone. He had no use for<br />any
    other being. During their first brief rest stop, Galdar had made the mistake
    of<br />approaching the horse to hold Mina’s stirrup as she dismounted, as
    he had been<br />trained to do for his commander and with much better grace
    than he’d used for<br />Ernst Magit. Foxfire’s lip curled back over his
    teeth, his eyes gleamed with a<br />wild, wicked light that gave Galdar some
    idea of how the beast had come by his<br />name. Galdar hastily backed
    away.<br />Many horses are frightened by minotaurs. Thinking this might be
    the<br />problem, Galdar ordered one of the others to attend the
    commander.<br />Mina countermanded his order. “Stay back, all of you.
    Foxfire has no love<br />for any being other than myself. He obeys only my
    commands and then only<br />when my commands agree with his own instincts.
    He is very protective of his<br />rider, and I could not prevent him from
    lashing out at you if you came too near.”<br />She dismounted nimbly,
    without aid. Removing her own saddle and bridle,<br />she led Foxfire to
    drink. She fed him and brushed him down with her own hands.<br />The rest of
    the soldiers tended to their own weary mounts, saw them safely<br />settled
    for the night. Mina would not allow them to build a campfire. Solamnic<br />eyes
    might be watching, she said. The fire would be visible a long distance.<br />The
    men were as tired as the horses. They’d had no sleep for two days and a<br />night.
    The terror of the storm had drained them, the forced march left them all<br />shaking
    with fatigue. The excitement that had carried them this far began to ebb.<br />They
    looked like prisoners who have wakened from a wonderful dream of freedom to
    find that they still wear their shackles and their chains.<br />No longer
    crowned by lightning and robed with thunder, Mina looked like<br />any other
    girl, and not even a very attractive girl, more like a scrawny youth. The<br />Knights
    sat hunched over their food in the moonlit darkness, muttering that<br />they’d
    been led on a fool’s errand, casting Mina dark looks and angry
    glances.&nbsp;<br />One man even went so far as to say that any of the dark
    mystics could have<br />restored Galdar’s arm, nothing so special in
    that.<br />Galdar could have silenced them by pointing out that no dark
    mystic had<br />restored his arm, though he had begged them often enough.
    Whether they<br />refused because their powers were not strong or because he
    lacked the steel to<br />pay them, it was all the same to him. The dark
    mystics of the Knights of Neraka<br />had not given him an arm. This strange
    girl had and he was dedicated to her for<br />life. He kept quiet, however.
    He was ready to defend Mina with his life, should<br />that become
    necessary, but he was curious to see how she would handle the<br />increasingly
    tense situation.<br />Mina did not appear to notice that her command was
    slowly slipping away.<br />She sat apart from the men, sat above them,
    perched on an enormous boulder.<br />From her vantage point, she could look
    out across the mountain range, jagged<br />black teeth taking a bite out of
    the starry sky. Here and there, fires from the<br />active volcanoes were
    blots of orange against the black. Withdrawn, abstracted,<br />she was
    absorbed in her thoughts to the point that she seemed totally unaware of<br />the
    rising tide of mutiny at her back.<br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >“I’ll be damned if I’m riding to Sanction!”</mark
    >
    said one of the Knights. <mark class="marker-green">“You</mark><br /><mark
        class="marker-green"
        >know what’s waiting for us there. A thousand of the cursed Solamnics,
        that’s</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">what!”</mark><br /><mark
        class="marker-green"
        >“I’m off to Khur with the first light,”</mark
    >
    said another. <mark class="marker-green">“I must have been</mark><br /><mark
        class="marker-green"
        >thunderstruck to have come this far!”</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">“I’ll not stand first watch,”</mark> a
    third grumbled.
    <mark class="marker-green">“She won’t let us have a fire to</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >dry out our clothes or cook a decent meal. Let her stand first
        watch.”</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">“ Aye, let her stand first watch!”</mark>
    The others agreed.<br /><mark class="marker-green">“I intend to,”</mark>
    said Mina calmly. Rising from her seat, she descended to the<br />road. She
    stood astride it, her feet planted firmly. &nbsp;Arms crossed over her
    chest,<br />she faced the men<mark class="marker-green"
        >. “I will stand all the watches this night. You will need your</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >rest for the morrow. &nbsp;You should sleep.”</mark
    ><br />She was not angry. She was not sympathetic. She was certainly not<br />pandering
    to them, did not seem to be agreeing with them in hope of gaining<br />their
    favor. She was making a statement of fact, presenting a logical and
    rational<br />argument. The men would need their rest for the morrow.<br />The
    Knights were mollified, but still angry, behaving like children who’ve<br />been
    made the butt of a joke and don’t like it. Mina ordered them to make up<br />their
    beds and lie down.<br />The Knights did as they were told, grumbling that
    their blan-kets were still<br />wet and how could she expect them to sleep
    on the hard rock? They vowed, one<br />and all, to leave with the dawn.<br />Mina
    returned to her seat upon the boulder and looked out again at the stars<br />and
    the rising moon. She began to sing.<br />The song was not like the Song of
    Death, the terrible dirge sung to them by<br />the ghosts of Neraka. Mina’s
    song was a battle song. A song sung by the brave<br />as they march upon the
    foe, a song meant to stir the hearts of those who sing it, a<br />song meant
    to strike terror into the hearts of their enemies.<br /><br /><span
        style="color: #999"
        ><strong>Glory calls us</strong></span
    ><br /><span style="color: #999"
        ><strong>With trumpet’s tongue,</strong></span
    ><br /><span style="color: #999"
        ><strong>calls us do great deeds</strong></span
    ><br /><span style="color: #999"

    ><br /><span style="color: #999"><strong>the thirsty ground,</strong></span
    ><br /><span style="color: #999"><strong>the holy fire.</strong></span
    ><br /><br /><br />The song continued, a paean sung by the victors in their
    moment of triumph,<br />a song of reminiscence sung by the old soldier
    telling his tale of valor.<br />Closing his eyes, Galdar saw deeds of
    courage and bravery, and he saw,<br />thrilling with pride, that he was the
    one performing. &nbsp;these heroic feats. His<br />sword flared with the
    purple white of the lightning, he drank the blood of his<br />enemies. He
    marched from one glorious battle to the next, this song of victory on<br />his
    lips. &nbsp;Always Mina rode before him, leading him, inspiring him, urging
    him<br />to follow her into the heart of the battle. The purple white glow
    that emanated<br />from her shone on him.<br />The song ended. Galdar
    blinked, realized, to his astonishment and chagrin,<br />that he had fallen
    asleep. He had not meant to, he had intended to stand watch<br />with her.
    He rubbed his eyes, wished she would start singing again. The night<br />was
    cold and empty without the song. He looked around to see if the others
    felt<br />the same.<br />They slumbered deeply and peacefully, smiles on
    their lips. &nbsp;They had laid<br />their swords within reach on the ground
    beside them. Their hands closed over<br />the hilts as if they would leap up
    and race off to the fray in an instant. They were<br />sharing Galdar’s
    dream, the dream of the song.<br />Marveling, he looked at Mina to find her
    looking at him.<br />He rose to his feet, went to join her upon her rock.<br /><mark
        class="marker-green"
        >“Do you know what I saw, Commander?”</mark
    >
    he asked.<br />Her amber eyes had caught the moon, encased it.
    <mark class="marker-green">“1</mark><br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >know,”</mark
    ><br />she replied.<br />“Will you do that for me, for us? Will you lead us
    to victory?”<br />The amber eyes, holding the moon captive, turned upon
    him.<br /><mark class="marker-green">“I will.”</mark><br /><mark
        class="marker-green"
        >“Is it your god who promises you this?”</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">“It is,” she replied gravely.</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >“Tell me the name of this god, that I may worship him,”</mark
    >
    said<br />Galdar.<br />Mina shook her head slowly, emphatically. Her gaze
    left the minotaur, went<br />back to the sky, which was unusually dark, now
    that she had captured the moon.<br />The light, the only light, was in her
    eyes. “It is not the right time.”<br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >“When will it be the right time?” </mark
    >Galdar pursued.<br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >“Mortals have no faith in anything anymore. They are like</mark
    ><br />men lost in a fog who can see no farther than their own noses, and so
    that is<br />what they follow, if they follow anything at all. Some are so
    paralyzed with fear<br />that they are afraid to move. The people must
    acquire faith in themselves before<br />they are ready to believe in
    anything beyond themselves.”
    <mark class="marker-green"
        >“Will you do this, Commander? Will you make this happen.”</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">“Tomorrow, you will see a miracle,”</mark>
    she said.<br />Galdar settled himself upon the rock. “Who are you,<br />Com-<br />mander?”
    he asked. “Where do you come from?”<br />Mina turned her gaze upon him and
    said, with a half-smile, “Who are you,<br />Sub commander? Where do you come
    from?”<br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >“Why, I’m a minotaur. I was born in-“</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">“No.”</mark> She shook her head
    gently.<mark class="marker-green">
        “Where before that?” “Before I was born?”</mark
    ><br />Galdar was confused.<mark class="marker-green">
        “I don’t know. No person does.”</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">“Precisely,” </mark>said Mina and turned
    away.<br />Galdar scratched his homed head, shrugged in his turn. Obviously
    she did<br />not want to tell him, and why should she? It was none of his
    business. It made no<br />difference to him. She was right. &nbsp;He had not
    believed in anything before this<br />moment. Now he had found something in
    which to believe. He had found Mina.<br />She confronted him again, said
    abruptly, “Are you still tired?”<br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >“No, Talon Leader, I am not,”</mark
    >
    Galdar replied. He had slept<br />only a few hours, but the sleep had left
    him unusually refreshed.<br />Mina shook her head. “Do not call me ‘Talon
    Leader.’ I want<br />you to call me ‘Mina.’ “<br /><mark
        class="marker-green"
        >“That is not right, Talon Leader,”</mark
    >
    he protested. “Calling you by your name<br />does not show proper
    respect.”<br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >“If the men have no respect for me, will it matter what they call
        me?”</mark
    >
    she<br />returned.<mark class="marker-green"> “Besides,”</mark> she added
    with calm convic-Ition,
    <mark class="marker-green">“the rank I hold does not</mark><br /><mark
        class="marker-green"
        >yet exist.”</mark
    ><br />Galdar really thought she was getting a bit above herself now, needed
    taking<br />down a notch or two. “Perhaps you think you should be the ‘Lord
    of the Night,’”<br />he suggested by way of a joke, naming the highest rank
    that could be held by the<br />Knights of Neraka.<br />Mina did not laugh.
    <mark class="marker-green"
        >“Someday, the Lord of the Night will kneel down before</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">me.”</mark><br />Galdar knew Lord Targonne
    well, had difficulty imagining the greedy,<br />grasping, ambitious man
    kneeling to do anything unless it might be to scoop up a<br />dropped
    copper. Galdar didn’t quite know what to say to such a ludicrous<br />concept
    and so fell silent, returning in his mind to the dream of glory, reaching<br />for
    it as a parched man reaches out to water. He wanted so much to believe in
    it,<br />wanted to believe it was more than mirage.<br /><mark
        class="marker-green"
        >“If you are certain you are not tired, Galdar,” </mark
    >Mina continued, <mark class="marker-green">“I want to ask</mark><br /><mark
        class="marker-green"
        >a boon of you.”</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">“Anything, Tal-Mina,” </mark>he said,
    faltering.<br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >“Tomorrow we ride into battle.”</mark
    >
    A little frown line marred Mina’s<br />smooth complexion. “I have no weapon,
    nor have I ever been trained in the<br />use of one. Have we time to do so
    tonight, do you think?”<br />Galdar’s jaw went slack. He wondered if he’d
    heard correctly. &nbsp;He was so<br />stunned, he could at first make no
    reply.
    <mark class="marker-green">“You. . . &nbsp;you’ve never wielded a</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">weapon?”</mark><br />Mina shook her head
    calmly.<br />“Have you ever been in battle, Mina?”<br />She shook her head
    again.<br /><mark class="marker-green">“Have you ever seen a battle?”</mark>
    Galdar was feeling desperate.<br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >“No, Galdar.”</mark
    >
    Mina smiled at him.
    <mark class="marker-green">“That is why I am asking</mark><br /><mark
        class="marker-green"
        >for your help. We will go a little ways down the road to practice, so
        that we</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >will not disturb the others. Do not worry. They will be safe. Foxfire
        would warn</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green"
        >me if an enemy approached. &nbsp;Bring along whatever weapon you think
        would be</mark
    ><br /><mark class="marker-green">easiest for me to learn.”</mark><br />Mina
    walked off down the road to find a suitable practice field, leaving an<br />amazed
    Galdar to search through the weapons he and the others carried, to find<br />one
    suitable for her, a girl who had never before held a weapon and who was,<br />tomorrow,
    going to lead them into battle.<br />Galdar cudgeled his brain, tried to
    knock some common sense back into his<br />head. A dream seemed reality,
    reality seemed a dream. Drawing his dagger, he<br />stared at it a moment,
    watched the moonlight flow like quicksilver along the<br />blade. He jabbed
    the point of the dagger into his arm, the arm Mina had restored<br />to him.
    Stinging pain and the warm flow of blood indicated that the arm was<br />real,
    confirmed that he was indeed awake.<br />Galdar had given his promise, and
    if he had one thing left to him in this life<br />that he hadn’t sold,
    battered, or flung away, it was his honor. He slid the dagger<br />back into
    its sheathe upon his belt and looked over the stock of weapons.<br />A sword
    was out of the question. There was no time to train her properly in<br />its
    use, she would do more damage to herself or those around than to a foe.
    He<br />could find nothing that he deemed suitable, and then he noticed the
    moonlight<br />shining on one weapon in particular, as if it were trying to
    bring it to his<br />attention-the weapon known as a morning star. Galdar
    eyed it. &nbsp;Frowning<br />thoughtfully, he hefted it in his hand. The
    morning star is a battlehammer<br />adorned with spikes on the end, spikes
    the fan-ciful said give it the look of a star
