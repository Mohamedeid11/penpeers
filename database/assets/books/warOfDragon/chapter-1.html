    The dwarves named the valley Gamashinoch-the Song of Death. None of the<br />living
    walked here of their own free will. Those who entered did so out of<br />desperation,
    dire need, or because they had been ordered to do so by their<br />commanding
    officer.<br />They had been listening to the” song” for several hours as
    their advance<br />brought them nearer and nearer the desolate valley.
    &nbsp;The song was eerie, terrible.<br />Its words, which were never clearly
    heard, never quite distinguishable-at least<br />not with the ears-spoke of
    death and worse than death. The song spoke of entrapment, <br/> bitter
    frustration, unending torment. The song was a lament, a song of<br />longing
    for a place the soul remembered, a haven of peace and bliss now<br />unattainable.<br />On
    first hearing the mournful song, the Knights had reined in their steeds,<br />hands
    reaching for their swords as they stared about them in unease, crying<br />“what
    is that?” and “who goes there?”<br />But no one went there. No one of the
    living. The Knights looked at their<br />commander, who stood up in his
    stirrups, inspect-ing the cliffs that soared above<br />them on their right
    and the left. &nbsp;“It is nothing,” he said at last. “The wind among<br />the
    rocks.<br />Proceed.”<br />He urged his horse forward along the road, which
    ran, turn-ing and twisting,<br />through the mountains known as the Lords of
    Doom. The men under his<br />command followed single file, the pass was too
    narrow for the mounted patrol to<br />ride abreast.<br />“I have heard the
    wind before, my lord,” said one Knight gruffly, “and it has<br />yet to have
    a human voice. It warns us to stay away. We would do well to heed<br />it.”<br />“Nonsense!”
    Talon Leader Ernst Magi swung around in his saddle to glare<br />at his
    scout and second-in-command, who walked behind him. “Superstitious<br />claptrap!
    But then you minotaur's are noted for clinging to old, outmoded ways
</p>
<p>
    and ideas. It is time you entered the modem era. The gods are gone, and
    good<br />riddance, I say. We humans rule the world.”<br />A single voice, a
    woman’s voice, had first sung the Song of Death. Now her<br />voice was
    joined by a fearful chorus of men, women, and children raised in a<br />dreadful
    chant of hopeless loss and misery that echoed among the mountains.<br />At
    the doleful sound, several of the horses balked, refused to go farther,
    and,<br />truth told, their masters did little to urge them. &nbsp;Magit’s
    horse shied and danced.<br />He dug his spurs into the horse’s flanks,
    leaving great bloody gouges, and the<br />horse sulked forward, head
    lowered, ears twitching. Talon Leader Magit rode<br />about half a mile when
    it occurred to him that he did not hear other hoof beats.<br />Glancing
    around, he saw that he was proceed-ing alone. None of his men had<br />followed.<br />Furious,
    Magit turned and galloped back to his command. He found half of<br />his
    patrol dismounted, the other half looking very ill at ease; sitting
    astride<br />horses that stood shivering on the road.<br />“The dumb beasts
    have more brains than their masters,” said the minotaur<br />from his place
    on the ground. Few horses will allow a minotaur to sit upon their<br />backs
    and fewer still have the strength and girth to carry one of the huge<br />minotaurs.
    Galdar was seven feet tall, counting his horns. He kept up with the<br />patrol,
    running easily alongside the stirrup of his commander.<br />Magit sat upon
    his horse, his hands on the pommel, facing his men. He was a<br />tall,
    excessively thin man, the type whose bones seem to be strung together
    with<br />steel wire, for he was far stronger than he looked. His eyes were
    flat and watery<br />blue, without intelligence, without depth. He was noted
    for his cruelty, his<br />inflexible-many would say mindless-discipline, and
    his complete and total<br />devotion to a single cause: Ernst Magit.<br />“You
    will mount your horses and you will ride after me,” said Talon Leader<br />Magit
    coldly, “or I will report each and every one of you to the<br />groupcommander.
    I will accuse you of cowardice and betrayal of the Vision and<br />mutiny.
    As you know, the penalty for even one of those counts is death.”<br />“Can
    he do that?” whispered a newly made Knight on his first assignment.<br />“He
    can,” returned the veterans grimly, “and he will.”<br />The Knights
    remounted and urged their steeds forward, using<br />their spurs. They were
    forced to circle around the minotaur, Galdar, who<br />remained standing in
    the center of the road.<br />“Do you refuse to obey my command, minotaur?”
    demanded Magit angrily.<br />“Think well before you do so. You may be the
    pro-tege of the Protector of the<br />Skull, but I doubt if even he could
    save you if I denounce you to the Council as a<br />coward and an
    oath-breaker.” Leaning over his horse’s neck, Magit spoke in mock
    confi-dentiality. “And<br />from what I hear, Galdar, your master might not
    be too keen on protecting you<br />anymore. A one-armed minotaur. A minotaur
    whose own kind view him with<br />pity and with scorn. A minotaur who has
    been reduced to the position of scout.’<br />And we all know that they
    assigned you to that post only because they had to do<br />something with
    you. Although I did hear it suggested that they turn you out to<br />pasture
    with the rest of the cows.”<br />Galdar clenched his fist, his remaining
    fist, driving the sharp nails into his<br />flesh. He knew very well that
    Magit was baiting him, goading him into a fight.<br />Here, where there
    would be few witnesses. Here where Magit could kill the<br />crippled
    minotaur and return home to claim that the fight had been a fair and<br />glori-ous
    one. Galdar was not particularly attached to life, not since the loss of<br />his
    sword arm had transformed him from fearsome warrior to plodding scout.<br />But
    he’d be damned if he was going to die at the hands of Ernst Magit. Galdar<br />wouldn’t
    give his commander the satisfaction.<br />The minotaur shouldered his way
    past Ernst Magit, who watched him with a<br />sneer of contempt upon his
    thin lips. &nbsp;The patrol continued toward their<br />destination, hoping
    to reach it while there was yet sunlight-if one could term the<br />chill
    gray light that warmed nothing it touched sunlight. The Song of Death<br />wailed
    and mourned. One of the new recruits rode with tears streaming down his<br />cheeks.
    The veterans rode hunkered down, shoulders hunched up around their<br />ears,
    as if they would block out the sound. But even if they had stuffed their
    ears<br />with tow, even if they had blown out their eardrums, they would
    have still heard<br />the terrible song.<br />The Song of Death sang in the
    heart.<br />The patrol rode into the valley that was called Neraka.<br />In
    a time past memory, the goddess Takhisis, Queen of Darkness, laid in the<br />southern
    end of the valley a foundation stone, rescued from the blasted temple of<br />the
    Kingpriest of Istar. The foundation stone began to grow, drawing upon the<br />evil
    in the world to give it lif~: The st~ne grew into a temple, vast and awful;
    a<br />temple of magnificent, hideous darkness.<br />Takhisis planned to use
    this temple to return to the world from which she’d<br />been driven by Huma
    Dragonbane, but her way was blocked by love and selfsacrifice. <br/> Nevertheless
    she had great power, and she launched a war upon the<br />world that came
    near to destroying it. Her evil commanders, like a pack of wild<br />dogs,.fell.to
    figh~g among themselves. A band of heroes rose up Looking mto<br />theIr
    hearts, they found the power to thwart her, defeat her, and cast her
    down.<br />Her temple at Neraka was destroyed, blasted apart in her rage at
    her downfall.<br />The temple’s walls exploded and rained down from the
    skies on that terrible day, <br /> huge black boulders that crushed the city of
    Neraka. Cleansing fires<br />destroyed the buildings of the cursed city,
    burned down its markets and its slave<br />pens, its numerous guard houses,
    filling its twisted, mazelike streets with ash.<br />Over fifty years later,
    no trace of the original city remained. &nbsp;The splinters of<br />the
    temple’s bones littered the floor of the south-em portion of the valley
    of<br />Neraka. The ash had long since blown away. Nothing would grow in
    this part of<br />the valley. All sign of life had long been covered up by
    the swirling sands.<br />Only the black boulders, remnants of the temple,
    remained in the valley.<br />They were an awful sight, and even Talon Leader
    Magit, gazing upon them for<br />the first time, wondered privately if his
    decision to ride into this part of the<br />valley had been a smart one. He
    could have taken the long route around, but that<br />would have added two
    days to his travel, and he was late as it was, having spent<br />a few extra
    nights with a new whore who had ar-rived at his favorite<br />bawdyhouse. He
    needed to make up time, and he’d chosen as his shortcut this<br />route
    through the southern end of the valley.<br />Perhaps due to the force of the
    explosion, the black rock that had formed the<br />outer walls of the temple
    had taken on a crys-talline structure. Jutting up from<br />the sand, the
    boulders were not craggy, not lumpy. They were smooth-sided,<br />with
    sharply de-fined planes culminating in faceted points. Imagine black
    quartz<br />crystals jutting up from gray sand, some four times the height
    of a man. Such a<br />man could see his reflection in those glossy black
    planes, a reflection that was<br />distorted, twisted, yet completely
    recognizable as being a reflection of himself.<br />These men had willingly
    joined up with the army of the Knights of Takhisis,<br />tempted by the
    promises of loot and slaves won in battle, by their own delight in<br />killing
    and bullying, by their hatred of elves or kender or dwarves or anyone<br />different
    from themselves. These men, long since hardened against every good<br />feeling,
    looked into the shining black plane of the crystals and were appalled by<br />the
    faces that looked back. For on those faces they could see their mouths<br />opening
    to sing the terrible song.<br />Most looked and shuddered and quickly
    averted their gaze. &nbsp;Galdar took care<br />not to look. At first sight
    of the black crystals rising from the ground, he had<br />lowered his eyes,
    and he kept them lowered out of reverence and respect. Call it<br />superstition,
    as Ernst Magit most certainly would. The gods themselves were not<br />m
    this valley. Galdar knew that to be impossible; the gods had been driven
    from<br />Krynn more than thirty years ago. But the ghosts of the gods
    lingered here, of<br />that Galdar was certain.<br />Ernst Magit looked at
    his reflection in the rocks, and simply because he<br />shrank from it
    inwardly, he forced himself to stare at It until he had stared it<br />down.
