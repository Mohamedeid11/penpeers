<p><span style="color:#000;">Danielle McNally is typical of young feature writers working for magazines these days. She</span><br><span style="color:#000;">had recently graduated from college with a journalism degree and was looking for a job in the</span><br><span style="color:#000;">magazine industry. McNally, originally from St. Petersburg, FL, headed for New York City,</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the center of magazine publishing in the United States, just weeks after she finished school.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Armed with an internship at a national magazine and considerable experience as the founding</span><br><span style="color:#000;">editor of her undergraduate campus magazine at the University of Miami, she had high hopes</span><br><span style="color:#000;">of finding work and beginning her climb up the editorial ladder to write for, and eventually</span><br><span style="color:#000;">edit, a national magazine.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her big step was an internship between her junior and senior years at a New York magazine.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">She explained:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>In the summer of 2007, I was chosen as the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME)</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>intern at Food &amp; Wine. The experience I garnered from this internship was invaluable. First&nbsp;</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>of all, it gave me a first-person look at the dynamism that occurs as a major national magazine</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>comes together. I experienced an energy and a work-style and schedule that I had not yet</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>encountered at my previous internships with regional magazines in Miami or in my school&nbsp;</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>work. I was able to partake in all aspects of magazine production from the very initial stages&nbsp;</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>of research to conceptualizing the design and photography elements to fact-checking and&nbsp;</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>copy-editing. My personal responsibilities consisted mostly of assisting and conducting research</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>for my supervising editor, but I was also able to write my own pieces for the magazine’s&nbsp;</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>website. These included a Q&amp;A interview with a well-known New York sommelier, a sidebar&nbsp;</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>on organic charitable initiatives, and a blog about the premier of food-themed movie,&nbsp;</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>No Reservations.</i></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">After finishing her internship, she returned to her senior year and became the moving force</span><br><span style="color:#000;">toward creation of a new campus magazine hosted by her school’s journalism program. “I took</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the managerial aspects of producing a magazine that I learned at Food &amp; Wine (scheduling,</span><br><span style="color:#000;">organization, interaction between departments) and brought that back with me to the University of Miami and my new endeavor, Distraction,” McNally (personal communication to author,</span><br><span style="color:#000;">September 3, 2008) explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>Working on Distraction was the best learning experience I had in college. I had never before</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>been an editor. Although I had worked with my peers on group projects and stories with multiple</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>writers, I had never had to be in charge of such a large group or to make so many varied,</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>important decisions. Managing my peers was both challenging and educational. Suddenly I had to</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>consider not just my own writer’s perspective on a story, but also the personality and focus of the</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>magazine and its audience. I had to consider style, fit and design when editing a story. As feature</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>writers, we often only think about how we believe the story should be told. We focus only on the</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>words. But as an editor, I had to consider both the writer’s point of view and the magazine’s,</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>which in turn made me a much better writer. As writers, especially when pitching ideas to editors,</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>we should consider all the aspects of the story’s final product. For features, writers should submit</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>their own suggestions for sidebars, heads and decks, captions for photos and ways to package the</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>story. I also learned how important it was for a writer to pay attention to the parameters the editor</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>has given. Numerous times while editing Distraction I received stories more than three times the</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>assigned word length or in a voice completely opposite of what my staff and I had envisioned</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>when planning the story. This was extremely frustrating. However, I still had to cut and edit my</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>peers’ stories. After the magazine came out, some writers were upset at the changes made to the</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>stories they had written. This was one of the more difficult parts of editing Distraction. However,</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>by the second issue, I used this to better explain to writers what was expected. Through all the</i></span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;"><i>editing I did, it actually helped me become a much better writer.</i></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">McNally and her staff wrote and produced two issues of the new magazine before school</span><br><span style="color:#000;">ended that year. McNally was then quite lucky to find work in the magazine industry in</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Manhattan so quickly after graduation. But her preparation as a student made a big difference</span><br><span style="color:#000;">and got editors to notice her.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">I started my job hunt during the spring semester of my senior year, sending cover letters to</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">contacts I had made during my time in New York previously and going on informational</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">interviews. In an effort to get my foot in the door at as many magazines as possible, I spent one</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">afternoon at Barnes &amp; Noble going through the masthead of every magazine that interested me. I</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">took down the name of the executive editor (or a comparable position) and sent each of those</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">people a copy of my cover letter, resume, Distraction, and a handful of other clips. While this did</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">help me secure more interviews (and I would definitely suggest this to other job-hunters), I</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">actually got my job with a little bit of luck.</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon arriving in New York, I attended a reunion for ASME alums. There my internship</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">coordinator introduced me to an alumna from a few years previous, Tracy Saelinger, who was</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">working on the launch of a new food magazine, Food Network Magazine. He felt I would be a</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">good fit for the publication because of my experience at Food &amp; Wine. The next day I sent my</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">resume to Tracy and she called me for an interview later that week. A few days after that, the</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">Editor in Chief, Mile Carpenter, called to offer me the job. Using my network and connections,</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">as well as previous experience in the specific field and genre I wanted to enter, combined to land</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">me the job. I have really enjoyed my time at Food Network Magazine thus far. Since it is a launch, the staff is very small (only 8 people on the edit side, including interns), and I have been</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">given quite a bit of responsibility. I have a lot of administrative duties as the assistant to the editor</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">in chief. But I am also lucky enough to have my own stories to write and pages to edit; I work on</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">production, and participate in tons of research and creative content development. I edit the basic</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">Front of Book pages, including the masthead and star index. But I also have written short newsy</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">pieces and market descriptions for our holiday gift guide. My written involvement has increased</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">with the second issue, and they have selected several of the ideas I pitched for inclusion in future</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">issues. I think one of the great things about this job is that it gives me the opportunity to move</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">into larger responsibilities more quickly than I would be allowed at an established magazine</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">with a fuller staff.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">Her magazine is new. She was on staff for two months before it published the first issue. “Food</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Network Magazine is a joint venture between Hearst Publications and the Food Network. I</span><br><span style="color:#000;">feel like this project was meant for me,” she explained (personal communication to author,</span><br><span style="color:#000;">September 19, 2008).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">My experience as an intern at Food &amp; Wine last summer, then launching Distraction last year,</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">combined to prepare me for this exact magazine! Distraction was certainly a huge help in</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">securing this job. Since it is a launch, the staff is very small (only eight people on the editorial</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">side, including interns), and I have been given quite a bit of responsibility. In addition to acting as</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">the assistant to the editor in chief, I have my own stories to write, pages to edit, work on</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">production, and participate in tons of research and creative content development.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">McNally also finds time to freelance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">Additionally, I have been doing free-lance reporting for People magazine in my spare time. I have</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">less and less of that (spare time) as my work load at Food Network Magazine becomes heavier,</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">but it has been good experience to see how reporting is handled at a weekly as well.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like McNally or any other young professional feature writer or magazine staff member,</span><br><span style="color:#000;">it will take large amounts of time and considerable effort to succeed. You have to ask yourself</span><br><span style="color:#000;">some tough questions about your abilities. For example, could you write a definitive discussion</span><br><span style="color:#000;">of cloning procedures and related ethical issues for U.S. News &amp; World Report? Or could you</span><br><span style="color:#000;">write a profile of the hottest new East Coast political leader for The New Yorker or The New</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Republic? Or a new film star for People? Can you prepare a compelling article about babies</span><br><span style="color:#000;">suffering from cancer for Family Circle? Or could you write a highly descriptive and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">entertaining piece about the nightlife on South Beach in Miami Beach for Ocean Drive? Could</span><br><span style="color:#000;">you write a guide to the best mountain hiking trails for Condé Nast Traveler or a human interest</span><br><span style="color:#000;">article about grandchildren in Modern Maturity? Could you write a travel feature focusing on</span><br><span style="color:#000;">finding bargain airfares in the Chicago Tribune Sunday edition?</span><br><span style="color:#000;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Is this over your head? Probably. For now, perhaps.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Give yourself time. Find your own level. Maybe you could write a short review of the</span><br><span style="color:#000;">newest Lindsay Lohan movie in your campus newspaper or even your local newspaper’s</span><br><span style="color:#000;">weekend or entertainment sections. Maybe you could write a humorous column for your campus newspaper or a campus-based World Wide Web site, or perhaps you could prepare a holiday</span><br><span style="color:#000;">story about foreign students at your school who are experiencing their first Thanksgiving or</span><br><span style="color:#000;">taking their first final exams. Maybe you can handle a personality sketch of a nearby high</span><br><span style="color:#000;">school athlete who recently set a school scoring record.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Do these seem to be more reachable goals for you? Possibly. But perhaps not yet. Start</span><br><span style="color:#000;">by writing about what you know. Feature writing includes all of these possibilities, even those</span><br><span style="color:#000;">for the top national and international publications, and they are attainable with a lot of hard</span><br><span style="color:#000;">work and development of your talents.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">You may wish to become a feature writer. You like the idea of writing for mass media</span><br><span style="color:#000;">such as newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and online publications. You may have an interest</span><br><span style="color:#000;">in writing features or perhaps someone once told you that you could write, saying that you</span><br><span style="color:#000;">might have what it takes to become a journalist or a novelist. If you want to be a successful</span><br><span style="color:#000;">professional feature writer, then you have to be willing to sweat.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">You have to like people and be willing to spend time with them, too. You have to be</span><br><span style="color:#000;">willing to live with frustration. You have to make personal and professional sacrifices. You</span><br><span style="color:#000;">have to be willing to work long hours. You have to be willing to take little or no remuneration</span><br><span style="color:#000;">in the beginning. You have to have a strong desire to publish your writing. If you are still with</span><br><span style="color:#000;">me after those admonitions, welcome to the world of feature writing. You might just have</span><br><span style="color:#000;">what it takes to be a staff or a freelance feature writer. It is important to emphasize the difficulty</span><br><span style="color:#000;">of being a successful professional writer. Yet for those who do have the drive and talent to</span><br><span style="color:#000;">succeed, there can be significant personal and professional rewards. Your first byline will</span><br><span style="color:#000;">be highly satisfying. So will the second, or third, or 400th. The euphoria you feel from this</span><br><span style="color:#000;">accomplishment at any level, from student newspaper to major international magazine, is</span><br><span style="color:#000;">equaled by little else in professional writing. And beginners do have a chance at making it.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">With the right idea at the right time, you can become a published feature writer early in your</span><br><span style="color:#000;">career.</span><br>&nbsp;</p>
