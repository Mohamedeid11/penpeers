Features are a large part of what people read in their<br>newspapers, magazines, and newsletters, and this book tries to guide motivated writers down<br>the right path. It emphasizes writing values that will strengthen the reader’s journalistic<br>practices. The purpose of this fifth edition is the same as that of the original, second, third,<br>and fourth editions: to give advanced writers and reporters a thorough look at newspaper,<br>magazine, newsletter, and online feature writing. To fully appreciate its contents, readers need<br>an introduction to writing and reporting for newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and online<br>publications before starting this book.<br>An advanced student should find it filled with good advice for writing different types of<br>features. The book offers lists of tips, observations, and guidelines for writers. Similarly, lists<br>of sources and story ideas are often offered in each chapter. To accomplish these goals, the<br>book required many sources of information.<br>It is a collection of a wide variety of perspectives and experiences of the author and other<br>experienced writers, editors, publishers, and professors. This volume should be a solid tour of<br>the different forms and approaches to feature writing.<br>There are several points to note about the book. First, the book is geared to advanced<br>student writers and beginning professionals. Readers should have a foundation in writing basics<br>from beginning writing and reporting classes to get the most from this material. There are no<br>exercises or other classroom activities.<br>Students are expected to practice their feature writing and reporting in the world around<br>them while working on fresh assignments that can lead to publication in their campus news<br>media outlets or in other publications. Second, this book focuses on newspaper, magazine,<br>newsletter, and online publications with emphasis on daily newspapers and consumer<br>magazines.<br>This latest edition emphasizes three primary aspects of feature writing: (1) introduction<br>and writing skills or basics; (2) article types; and (3) the collegiate and professional writing<br>life. In each chapter, you will learn from the narrative, from the advice of professionals, and<br>by example. In each chapter, there are excerpts and complete articles from some of the nation’s<br>leading publications that illustrate points made in the text. Although most of the examples in<br>this edition are new, a handful of the very best examples written by award-winning journalists<br>from the first three editions have been retained.<br>I have taken much of the material here from 33-plus years of feature writing and reporting<br>classes at three different universities, but most comes from my time as a faculty member at the<br>University of Miami. I also add 6 years of full-time reporting and editing experience at daily<br>newspapers, including 3 years as an entertainment beat writer and music reviewer. I spent more<br>than a year launching and editing an international subscription newsletter, Money Laundering<br>Alert, several years of freelance writing for magazines and newspaper travel sections, and a<br>decade of editing special features projects and sections for daily and weekly newspapers in South<br>Florida. I hope you will learn as much from it as I did putting it all together.</p>
