He cannot get out of it very often to pursue news and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">feature stories as easily as he would like. Security is far too strict and conditions where he</span><br><span style="color:#000;">writes and reports can be quite dangerous at times. Londoño is a correspondent based in Baghdad</span><br><span style="color:#000;">for The Washington Post. Because of the circumstances of his bureau’s location and the war</span><br><span style="color:#000;">surrounding him, his reporting and story writing opportunities are often limited by safety and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">access issues. But he still writes regularly about the U.S. troops and other events in Iraq. In</span><br><span style="color:#000;">his second assignment in Iraq, the young journalist, who joined The Post after working as a</span><br><span style="color:#000;">city desk reporter for the Dallas Morning News, still searches for a good feature story to balance</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the breaking news he is expected to provide to readers of his newspaper and its Web site.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">“Although what we do here fits the traditional hard news mold nine times out of 10, some</span><br><span style="color:#000;">of the most compelling and well-read stories we do are strong narratives,” the 27-year-old</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Londoño (personal communication to author, September 6, 2008) said. “Those are typically</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the stories that really resonate with readers the most. They’re not always easy to pull off in a</span><br><span style="color:#000;">war zone, given the crush of news, but we’ve done plenty.”</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Londoño earned his bachelor’s degree in print journalism and Latin American studies at</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the University of Miami in 2003. After finishing school, he interned at The Washington Post</span><br><span style="color:#000;">and was given his first job at the Dallas Morning News. He joined The Post as a staff writer</span><br><span style="color:#000;">about two years later. He is now on his second assignment as a correspondent in Iraq, covering</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the conflict in the Middle East for his newspaper. Now working for The Post Foreign Service</span><br><span style="color:#000;">as a correspondent, his local experience helps him. He writes many breaking news stories from</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq, but he tries to find time for feature writing as well.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">“I covered criminal justice in suburban Maryland for nearly three years before getting a</span><br><span style="color:#000;">job on the foreign desk, based in Baghdad. I’ve been here since April 2008. My first Baghdad</span><br><span style="color:#000;">stint was a two-month rotation in early 2007,” he explained.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">I’m one of three Post staff writers in the Baghdad bureau. We have a large Iraqi staff that</span><br><span style="color:#000;">includes six reporters/interpreters and a handful of stringers in key provinces. We cover daily</span><br><span style="color:#000;">and breaking news and report and write feature stories. The latter is always challenging in Iraq,&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color:#000;">a fast-paced, dangerous and unpredictable place. It has become harder because we are increasingly asked to file stories for the web site and for the Financial Times, which have</span><br><span style="color:#000;">earlier deadlines.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our information comes from a variety of sources. We communicate daily with U.S.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">diplomats, the American military and Iraqi officials. We stay on top of the basics by reviewing</span><br><span style="color:#000;">press releases, checking the wires, making beat calls and monitoring the Iraqi press. But the best</span><br><span style="color:#000;">stories and scoops generally come from sources we’ve worked hard to cultivate. Most of our</span><br><span style="color:#000;">ideas for feature and other big-picture, enterprise stories originate in the bureau, but a few are</span><br><span style="color:#000;">conceived by editors in Washington. Our local staff is the best starting point. Our drivers,</span><br><span style="color:#000;">bodyguards and translators know Iraq far better than we ever will. And they often come to us</span><br><span style="color:#000;">with fascinating yarns.</span></p><p><span style="color:#000;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Londoño likes to write human interest features because he knows they are widely read. These</span><br><span style="color:#000;">stories are centered on the human side of war and focus on individuals or small groups of</span><br><span style="color:#000;">individuals.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#4C4CE6;"><mark class="marker-yellow">I find that stories about people—be it Iraqis or U.S. soldiers—are the ones that resonate most with</mark></span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;"><mark class="marker-yellow">readers. It’s hard to make a story about a car bomb compelling after six years of war. So we seek</mark></span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;"><mark class="marker-yellow">to take readers behind the scenes through the eyes of the people we meet. We like to tell them</mark></span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;"><mark class="marker-yellow">what war sounds like, feels like, looks like; how it changes lives, families and neighborhoods.</mark></span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;"><mark class="marker-yellow">There are no short cuts. Good journalism requires getting to the right place at the right time and</mark></span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;"><mark class="marker-yellow">spending as much time as you can there. It requires knowing when to ask questions and when to</mark></span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;"><mark class="marker-yellow">stand by, listen and observe.</mark></span></p><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">Londoño recently wrote a feature about soldiering in Iraq by focusing on a single man</span><br><span style="color:#000;">and his experiences. This is how it began:</span><br><span style="color:#000;">MOSUL, Iraq—An hour before sunrise, under a star-studded sky, 1st Lt. Michael Baxter’s</span><br><span style="color:#000;">soldiers packed their gear into Bradley Fighting Vehicles, heading out to patrol neighborhoods</span><br><span style="color:#000;">where fighting insurgents often seems like warring with shadows.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Soldiers took long drags on cigarettes before strapping 40 pounds of armor and gear onto</span><br><span style="color:#000;">their backs, saying little save for quick back-and-forth on radios. They crammed into the cabins&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color:#000;">of the tracked, armored vehicles that rattle like flimsy wooden roller-coaster cars and tuned out</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the sights and sounds of the city.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Mosul, a city in northern Iraq that straddles the Tigris River, has long been a stronghold of</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Sunni insurgents. When U.S. and Iraqi security forces aggressively fought Sunni extremists in</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Baghdad and other provinces, insurgents flocked to Mosul in recent months.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">The patrols took place on the eve of an offensive against the insurgents that Iraqi officials</span><br><span style="color:#000;">had vowed to undertake here. The offensive has been dubbed Lion’s Roar, and it may cast a</span><br><span style="color:#000;">spotlight on the readiness and competence of the Iraqi military and police in northern Iraq.</span></p><p><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">“This is their operation,” said Maj. Amanda Emmens-Rossi, a U.S. military spokeswoman in</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">Mosul. “It was conceived and led by the Iraqi military.”</mark></span></p><p><br><span style="color:#000;">U.S. military officials say an offensive here is unlikely to unfold like the 2004 battle</span><br><span style="color:#000;">of Fallujah, in which U.S. troops fought entrenched insurgent cells with considerable success.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">And the battle in Mosul is considerably different from recent fights in Baghdad and Basra.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">“This is not a Fallujah,” said Lt. Col. Christopher Johnson, commander of the 1st Battalion,</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">8th Infantry Regiment, which is deployed in eastern Mosul. Gathering intelligence on insurgent</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">networks has been daunting, and insurgents have seldom fought security forces face to face.</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">“They pick the time and place”. ..... (Londoño, 2008, p. A07)</mark></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">Londoño explained: “This story provided a compelling glimpse of what it’s like to be a soldier</span><br><span style="color:#000;">in Iraq now that there’s little face-to-face combat. Many soldiers have been here [Iraq] for</span><br><span style="color:#000;">three or four rotations. They have a hard, scary and frustrating job” (personal communication</span><br><span style="color:#000;">to author, September 28, 2008). “The best material for this story did not come from interviews.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">I got it by listening and observing—being a fly on the wall. That’s the key to reporting solid</span><br><span style="color:#000;">features.”</span><br><span style="color:#000;">There will be days when a good story idea comes to you easily, even in a dangerous war</span><br><span style="color:#000;">zone such as they do for Londoño, but there will be other days when an idea will be difficult</span><br><span style="color:#000;">to generate. Often, writers must develop workable ideas from circumstances, conditions, and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">surroundings that are important to their publication’s readers. During 2007 and 2008, travel</span><br><span style="color:#000;">was one of the industries seriously affected by sharp increases in oil and associated fuel costs.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">All aspects of the travel industry were impacted, from airlines to ships to buses, trains, and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">even personal automobiles. While gasoline, Jet-A fuel for airplanes, and other fuel prices went</span><br><span style="color:#000;">up, so did ticket prices and fill-ups at local gas station pumps. The travel industry and travelers</span><br><span style="color:#000;">were severely impacted. Fares jumped to new levels and some routes, both international and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">regional, were cut. More changes came to a huge industry in the face of a changing world</span><br><span style="color:#000;">economy. Priorities for travel were upended. Travel publications such as Travel &amp; Leisure and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Condé Nast Traveler published numerous articles about the new conditions and changes for</span><br><span style="color:#000;">readers. Newspapers with travel and business sections did much the same. In one example,</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Washington Post writer Sholnn Freeman (2008) prepared a news feature for the newspaper’s</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Financial section that told of travelers who were so frustrated that they were taking trains along</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the U.S. East Coast instead of flying. Using one traveler as an example, Freeman wrote:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#4CE64C;">Jada Golden stood in the waiting lounge at Union Station, explaining why Amtrak is a better way</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">to travel than an airline.</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">“It’s as heavy as we want,” Golden said, pointing to an oversize suitcase. “We can put it on</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">a rack in the rail car and get things out of it.”</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">Golden, 36 and a Boston schoolteacher, pointed to another bag—a large paper grocery bag</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">filled with sandwiches, salads, water and fruit. “You can bring food,” she said.</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">She continued. On the train, she’s free to pick her own seat and doesn’t have a flight</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">attendant telling her when to use electronics. And then there’s the airline stress factor—the</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">security headaches and the delays.</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">“You’re always delayed in the airport,” Golden said. “You always have connecting</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">flights.”</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">With delays, airport congestion and sky-high jet fuel prices draining the romance and</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">convenience of air travel, Americans have increasingly turned to Amtrak for summer travel.</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">(Freeman, 2008, p. D01)</span></p><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">The story then describes how people, such as this woman, are changing their travel habits. The</span><br><span style="color:#000;">story is built around more traveler anecdotes and, of course, some national Amtrak passenger</span><br><span style="color:#000;">statistics. Many story ideas such as this one can turn around rather rapidly and still illustrate</span><br><span style="color:#000;">trends or broader social or economic matters. However, the process of finding and developing</span><br><span style="color:#000;">feature story ideas can require patience and organization. It can also require a little serendipity</span><br><span style="color:#000;">or even luck.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span class="text-big" style="color:#000;"><strong>Getting Started</strong></span></li></ul><p><span style="color:#000;">Do you notice the ordinary and extraordinary things around you? When you drive to work or</span><br><span style="color:#000;">to school, do you make the extra effort to notice people or places or what is happening during</span><br><span style="color:#000;">that routine trip? Do you take time to look around when you go someplace new? What do you</span><br><span style="color:#000;">see? Is it interesting to you?</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Would it be interesting to others? Do you ever think of these observations as ideas for</span><br><span style="color:#000;">your writing?</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Have you met anyone new today? What does that person do for a living? Has your regular</span><br><span style="color:#000;">network of friends and acquaintances brought anything different or unique into your life</span><br><span style="color:#000;">recently? What did you do out of the ordinary this week? Was it fun? Was it informative? Was</span><br><span style="color:#000;">it significant? Did you learn anything from the experience? Would anyone else be interested?</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Any of these questions, if answered in the affirmative, might lead to a very good feature</span><br><span style="color:#000;">story. Finding feature ideas can be that easy. Some subjects practically announce their potential</span><br><span style="color:#000;">as a story to an alert writer. Others need the experienced eye and ear of a feature writer to</span><br><span style="color:#000;">work them into readable and salable articles.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Paying attention to what is going on around her is one of the major ways in which Liz</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Balmaseda, former columnist and feature writer for The Miami Herald who won the 1993</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Pulitzer Prize for commentary, said the entire city is what gives her ideas. “I look around and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">see what’s going on,” Balmaseda (personal communication to author, June 6, 1993) explained.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">“I talk to a lot of people and ask them to tell me what’s going on where they work and where</span><br><span style="color:#000;">they live.”</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Balmaseda said she also depends on people to call her with column and feature article</span><br><span style="color:#000;">ideas. As a highly visible columnist for one of the nation’s major daily newspapers, she gets</span><br><span style="color:#000;">large numbers of telephone calls and letters. “People will call me and give me ideas,” she said.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">“And I also talk to people in the newsroom. Reporters around the newsroom are crucial</span><br><span style="color:#000;">teammates for me. With their help, I look for wrongs—people who have been wronged”</span><br><span style="color:#000;">(personal communication to author, June 6, 1993).</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Feature writers have to notice details of things around them. You probably will not have</span><br><span style="color:#000;">such unusual experiences as Mt. Everest or Antarctic expeditions on which to base your articles.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">But stories can come from the ordinary, or seemingly ordinary. If you drive the same road to</span><br><span style="color:#000;">work or school every day, try to vary the route. Look at the scenery with an eye for story</span><br><span style="color:#000;">possibilities. For example, if you drive past the same house every day, look in the driveway.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">The old cars that the owner of the house is working on might be more than what they appear.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Is there a chance this person restores valuable older cars? Isn’t this a story prospect? Why not</span><br><span style="color:#000;">stop and ask a few questions?</span></p><p><span style="color:#000;">rofessor Margaret Davidson believes being a keen observer is what makes the biggest</span><br><span style="color:#000;">difference between a good writer and an average one, especially in terms of finding news and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">story ideas. “A good writer is a good observer—of people, surroundings, ideas and trends, and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the general flotsam and jetsam of the world around,” Davidson (1990, p. 7) explained. “Some</span><br><span style="color:#000;">people seem to go through life with blinders on. They are so wrapped up in their own comings</span><br><span style="color:#000;">and goings they are unaware of the ebb and flow around them. But others observe the world</span><br><span style="color:#000;">in sharp detail with the vision to see everything in perspective, appreciating its true value”&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color:#000;">(p. 7). Davidson also says this is especially true of college students. “For some of the students—</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the world seems to be a colorful and fascinating place with an endless supply of worthwhile</span><br><span style="color:#000;">news stories. But for many others it appears to be very a sterile, boring existence where little</span><br><span style="color:#000;">that is exciting ever happens” (p. 7). If you go somewhere new, think even before you leave</span><br><span style="color:#000;">home about what possibilities for stories and articles exist. If you like the destination, why?</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Would others like it also? If that new boutique has unusual or new designs, tell others about</span><br><span style="color:#000;">it—in a feature story.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Meeting someone new and different can be exciting, also. However, don’t think about the</span><br><span style="color:#000;">new acquaintance from a personal perspective. Think about him or her from a writer’s</span><br><span style="color:#000;">professional point of view. Is this person worthy of a feature story? What makes him or her</span><br><span style="color:#000;">interesting to readers? What has this person done that others would like to know? Perhaps the</span><br><span style="color:#000;">person is in town for just a few days and really lives in a foreign country—perhaps a relatively</span><br><span style="color:#000;">unknown small country like Belize in Central America. Wouldn’t this be a chance to write</span><br><span style="color:#000;">about the person, the country, and all the unusual aspects of life in a country that many</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Americans do not know much about?</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Finding story and article ideas are related to natural curiosity. Often, the best ideas occur</span><br><span style="color:#000;">when writers think like 3- or 4-year-olds, always asking “why?” and “how?” And you have</span><br><span style="color:#000;">to think about what you do each day—you did something unusual, even something as simple</span><br><span style="color:#000;">as deciding where to go for spring break or over a long weekend. You could write a story</span><br><span style="color:#000;">listing your own favorite places. Or compile a list from the information provided by tourism</span><br><span style="color:#000;">and visitors bureaus. Those might just make a good story.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span class="text-big" style="color:#000;"><strong>Identifying Potential Feature Article Material</strong></span></li></ul><p><span style="color:#000;">What makes a great feature article idea—an idea that gets published? Just about everything</span><br><span style="color:#000;">around you is possible feature material. Use your senses. Look around. Absorb. Notice. Listen.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Look. Your job is to take these undeveloped ideas and turn them into something interesting</span><br><span style="color:#000;">for readers. People can be the source and subject of some of the best story ideas. Often a</span><br><span style="color:#000;">powerful story about a successful person’s problems helps readers to see the “real” side of that</span><br><span style="color:#000;">individual. We learn from how he or she has experienced adversity and overcome it, or made</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the comeback to succeed a second time, lost a loved one, or survived a brush with death. These</span><br><span style="color:#000;">stories often make wonderful feature articles.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Williamson (1975) says finding a feature story idea should be easy. Those stories seem</span><br><span style="color:#000;">to jump out and practically scream, “Write me!” Williamson argued, “A great advantage in</span><br><span style="color:#000;">being a reporter is that you have a ‘license’ to find out about all those things you’ve always</span><br><span style="color:#000;">been curious about” (p. 70).</span></p><p><span style="color:#000;">New York Times “This Land” writer Dan Barry found an innovative and appealing</span><br><span style="color:#000;">approach to the national story about easy mortgages, unpaid loans, and foreclosed homes when</span><br><span style="color:#000;">he visited Fort Myers, Florida. But instead of simply talking to bankers, regulators, homeowners,</span><br><span style="color:#000;">victims of foreclosure, and residents in neighborhoods affected by the problem, he found a</span><br><span style="color:#000;">fresh approach. Barry found the one man in Fort Myers, a medium-sized city in southwest</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Florida, who worked for the City of Fort Myers and is responsible for mowing the lawns and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">boarding up the abandoned homes. It was a unique perspective that told a different story than</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the countless features published during a period of financial crisis in the United States. Barry</span><br><span style="color:#000;">(2008, p. A16) opened his story with this lead:</span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000;">FORT MYERS, Fla.—The lawn mower’s whine disrupts the morning peace of Coconut Drive</span><br><span style="color:#000;">like an alarm clock no one remembers setting. It rises and falls and rises again, as the angry</span><br><span style="color:#000;">machine cuts across the front-lawn jungle of an attractive house with great location and move-in</span><br><span style="color:#000;">potential.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Abandoned, in other words. Three years ago, sold for $660,000; today, a ghostly parcel of</span><br><span style="color:#000;">failure.</span></p><p><span style="color:#000;">Barry continued to tell the story of Shayne Becher, 39, who worked for the city code</span><br><span style="color:#000;">enforcement office. He spends his days cutting grass and hammering sheets of plywood onto</span><br><span style="color:#000;">exterior walls. Barry’s “nut graf”—the paragraph that tells readers why the story needs to be</span><br><span style="color:#000;">read—explains the big picture:</span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">“Beautiful,” he says. Then he drives a few blocks to another site of abandonment, on Sunset</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">Place.</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">Come to Fort Myers, population 60,000, the seat of Lee County. Walk the Gulf Coast</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">beaches. Cruise the Caloosahatchee River. Witness what happens when banks dole out easy</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">mortgages and homeowners forget that the money isn’t free. Drive down McGregor Boulevard, or</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">Cleveland Avenue, turn left or turn right, and see the empty houses, the overgrown lots, the signs</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;"><mark class="marker-green">saying AUCTION and FREE RENT (Barry, 2008, p. A16).</mark></span><br><span style="color:#000;">The story, published as part of the newspaper’s National Report, paints a grim picture that</span><br><span style="color:#000;">illustrates the desperation and suffering of homeowners, but also the problems they leave behind</span><br><span style="color:#000;">for the neighbors and the cities that must care for abandoned properties.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">The key to a successful story such as this one by Dan Barry is curiosity. Be curious about</span><br><span style="color:#000;">who takes care of the homes when they are left empty. Maybe you have not dealt with mortgage</span><br><span style="color:#000;">issues, of course, but maybe you know someone who has experienced the problem first hand.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Let these casual observations turn into story prospects, especially if you see a unique angle</span><br><span style="color:#000;">such as the man solely responsible for city maintenance of abandoned homes. Once you notice</span><br><span style="color:#000;">things, hear about something appealing, once you meet someone, once you discover something</span><br><span style="color:#000;">interesting to you, let your journalistic curiosity take over. Satisfy your inquisitiveness by finding</span><br><span style="color:#000;">out about the subject. How? If you always wanted to learn about sailing, go to a marina to</span><br><span style="color:#000;">interview a local sailor or take lessons at a nearby lake, or go to a nearby sailing club meeting.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Finding the right story idea is also dependent on the publication for which you will write</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the story. You need to know what sort of material the publication publishes. This is more easily &nbsp;done if you work for the publication, but it can be relatively easy to find out if you take time</span><br><span style="color:#000;">to research the publication and its market (Bowman, 1997). You also need to know the basic</span><br><span style="color:#000;">characteristics of feature ideas. What are they? Traditionally, good feature ideas have eight</span><br><span style="color:#000;">basic elements, according to Schoenfeld and Diegmueller (1982). Those elements are as</span><br><span style="color:#000;">follows:</span></p><ol><li><span style="color:#000;">Appeal to people—The story has to meet a need of the reader.</span></li><li><span style="color:#000;">Facts—A feature that works will contain certain information, or facts, about that</span><br><span style="color:#000;">subject that will be beneficial to readers in some way.</span></li><li><span style="color:#000;">Personalities—Facts are enhanced with personality. A story that can offer some</span><br><span style="color:#000;">unusual person or personality with facts and appeal will be much stronger.</span></li><li><span style="color:#000;">Angle—The right “slant” or theme makes the subject tie together better.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">5. Action—Can you make the story come alive? It will if you have some activity in the</span><br><span style="color:#000;">story. It is relatively simple—people should do something in your story.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">6. Uniqueness and universality—The topic should be different and should have broad</span><br><span style="color:#000;">appeal at the same time.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">7. Significance—Timeliness, proximity, prominence, and relevance create significance</span><br><span style="color:#000;">in a story.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">8. Energy increment—The story should stir your readers just as the idea stirred you to</span><br><span style="color:#000;">write the story. You should show your enthusiasm and sincerity.</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">Finally, think about the necessity that all feature ideas remain fresh. Just like bread, a feature</span><br><span style="color:#000;">idea has a certain shelf life and it is up to you as a writer to make certain the idea is developed</span><br><span style="color:#000;">and published in story form while it is still fresh. The best idea won’t work with editors or</span><br><span style="color:#000;">with readers if it is stale.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
