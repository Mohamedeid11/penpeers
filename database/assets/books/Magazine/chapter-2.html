Her small and relatively</span><br><span style="color:#000;">new magazine offers readers lifestyle, design, and fashion features and is growing in circulation.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Her career as a magazine writer and editor evolved in a conventional manner. An award-winning</span><br><span style="color:#000;">fiction writer, she came to the United States from Honduras in Central America She earned</span><br><span style="color:#000;">her bachelor’s degree at the University of Miami in 2003 and, at the same time, interned at</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the edgy fashion magazine Zink and eventually became its editor. Cantor did not wish to leave</span><br><span style="color:#000;">South Florida when the magazine relocated to New York City, so she went back to school to</span><br><span style="color:#000;">earn a master of fine arts degree in creative writing. Not long after finishing the degree, she</span><br><span style="color:#000;">became part of a team of three persons that launched and edited a real estate trade magazine</span><br><span style="color:#000;">published every two weeks, Miami Agent. Cantor eventually left Miami Agent and became</span><br><span style="color:#000;">senior editor of the monthly Palm Beach Illustrated magazine. During her time at the highend readership magazine, she wrote regular art and design columns, contributed to</span><br><span style="color:#000;">several front- and back-of-the-book sections, and wrote features about Palm Beach’s elite lifestyles, high society, and celebrity-level residents.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#4CE64C;">“All of my writing, regardless of the genre, is a combination of the sensibilities I’ve</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">developed while working simultaneously as a journalist and a fiction writer,” she tells readers</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">of her own Web site, MelissaCantor.com (Cantor, 2008).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#4C4CE6;"><i>I hope that my articles benefit from a strong sense of character or place, or a creative use of</i></span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;"><i>language, depending on what is called for. I also do my best to make sure that my literary</i></span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;"><i>endeavors are grounded in fact and real-world relevance.</i></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">Cantor occasionally teaches writing at the University of Miami, her alma mater for both of</span><br><span style="color:#000;">her bachelor’s and master’s degrees, and other South Florida colleges and universities. She</span><br><span style="color:#000;">has published fiction in essays and writes novels in the little bits of free time she can carve</span><br><span style="color:#000;">out of her busy schedule.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">As far as my work at Miami magazine (and really, my experience in general), what I suspect</span><br><span style="color:#000;">would be a salient point of interest to an aspiring journalist is what tiny staffs most magazines have. I have never worked on an editorial staff that consists of more than three people. (Cantor, personal communication to author, October 1, 2008)</span></p><p><span style="color:#000;">When we launched Miami, the local editorial staffers were the editor-in-chief and myself.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">However, we share “national” content across all 14 Modern Luxury city books. The national</span><br><span style="color:#000;">content is usually a celebrity feature, the fashion photo features, and the occasional travel piece.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Our art department is based in Chicago (the Modern Luxury magazines also share an art</span><br><span style="color:#000;">department, so our art director, for instance, works on five different books), so the way we</span><br><span style="color:#000;">interact with our designers is that we pass keylines back and forth on a server. It poses a</span><br><span style="color:#000;">particular challenge as an editor, because we must make notes on a document and try to</span><br><span style="color:#000;">communicate our vision, rather than sit beside an art director to help conceptualize a layout. We</span><br><span style="color:#000;">also assign all of our own photography, and the art directors are not involved in this process, so it</span><br><span style="color:#000;">is challenging for them as well, as they have no prior relationship to the stories when they receive</span><br><span style="color:#000;">the text and images. Our EIC moved back to New York in March of this year in order to launch</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Manhattan for Modern Luxury, so since then the Miami-based staff has consisted of an associate</span><br><span style="color:#000;">editor and myself.</span><br>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">What I do day-to-day is find story ideas, put together the editorial lineup for each issue</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">alongside the EIC, and then assign the stories and the photography to writers. I have to provide</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">the writers a story brief, word count and contact information for each story, so much of the initial</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">leg work is usually mine. Sometimes, if an idea comes from a freelancer, they do the work from</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">the very beginning, but there are really only one or two freelancers who really understand the</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">magazine to this extent. Because there are so many print media outlets based in Miami, we also</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">make a great effort to get our story ideas from sources other than publicists, because stories that</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">come from publicists tend to end up in all of our competitors’ books as well. We really have to</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">get out there, meet people and get story leads by word-of-mouth so that we can offer our readers</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">something different.</span></p><p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#000;">Cantor explained that her work as an editor of a small magazine is more than occasional writing</span><br><span style="color:#000;">and production work.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">Once we receive the stories, they usually require a heavy edit and fact checking. Selects also have</span><br><span style="color:#000;">to be done on the photography. Once the story is in layout form, I input captions, deal with any</span><br><span style="color:#000;">runover (or short) copy, and finalize. I also track invoices from freelancers, code accordingly, and</span><br><span style="color:#000;">submit to our accounting department, and keep track of our expenses so that we stay within our</span><br><span style="color:#000;">editorial budget for each issue.</span><br><span style="color:#000;">As an editor, finding time for her own writing is often a challenge. But she does continue to</span><br><span style="color:#000;">write. She explained:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color:#4CE64C;">Because the workload is so heavy, I don’t take on too many features. I tend to write shorter pieces</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">(and freelance). I don’t have a specialization in terms of my feature writing. But I do steer clear</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">of food reviews! In terms of writing, it has been easier for me to identify my weaknesses versus</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">any strengths and I enjoy the variety of writing about different topics. I find that my writing can</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">feel repetitive (to me), and I can get very bored of my voice, which seems to permeate all the journalism work that I do, so mixing up the topics helps mitigate that. I can’t imagine committing</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">to a single area of writing any time soon. Criticism in general is not my strong suit, with the</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">exception of fashion (reviewing collections). In general, I write a lot of profiles, interior design</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">stories, and stories about fashion and design. I approach everything with research. When I begin</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">to research, whether it’s a designer or a home owner or a neighborhood, I instantly start writing</span><br><span style="color:#4CE64C;">the story in my head, even if what I eventually write about ends up being very different.</span></p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:53.71%;"><img src="https://cdn.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/journalism-tactics-60812472af9db.png" alt="9 Journalism Tactics that Work for SEO Content Writing"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two things that have probably most contributed to my success are my ability to produce<br>clean and accurate copy (I’m a stickler for grammar and, as an editor, I know that this is both rare<br>and much appreciated, and I always verify my facts), and how much I read. I love magazines, and<br>reading them constantly not only gives me ideas, but great writing inspires me, as do the creative<br>ways in which people present information and draw in readers.<br>As far as tricks, again, my biggest tip is reading. I tend to be someone who senses her lead<br>instantly while doing an interview or research, and if I don’t, I get very stuck. Reading others<br>helps get my creativity going, and particularly if I can see how others have approached the same<br>topic, it helps me decide which angle to take. I also find that a couple of days of distance from a<br>story makes a world of difference. When I am writing a story, I am so close to it that I can no<br>longer read it objectively, while if I return to it a few days later, I can immediately sense what it<br>needs.<br>As far as advice for young writers, I know that I often have been—and still am sometimes—<br>afraid to ask questions. It can be intimidating to interview someone who is well-known, and I<br>think young writers in particular are hesitant to push any buttons, but I’ve found that the times<br>when I failed to ask a question, I regretted it much more than the times when I did and perhaps<br>angered someone by doing so.</p><p>One of Cantor’s more recently written magazine pieces appeared in Palm Beach Illustrated<br>magazine. The article, entitled “Class Distinctions” took a close look at Palm Beach County,<br>a wealthy South Florida region north of Miami and Fort Lauderdale, and its leading private<br>schools. Cantor prepared two sidebar articles to go with the main story, one containing a list<br>of basic information about five leading prep schools and the other discussing important factors<br>involving the schools that go beyond classroom teaching and facilities, such as consistency<br>and faith-based educational components.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">“Class Distinctions” was perhaps one of the most difficult I’ve written. There was so much</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">information to wade through, so many interviews to conduct and schools to tour and it was so</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">difficult to try and present a balanced perspective when there were so many issues on which</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">people have opposing but valid viewpoints. I think it was successful because the schools I was</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">writing about all happened to be so remarkable and provided so many interesting talking points;</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">and the people I interviewed were eloquent and dedicated. Both facts made my job infinitely</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">easier. In the end, I hope that in the story and the accompanying sidebars, I raised questions for</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">people who live in a world where elite private schools are the norm. And for those who do not, I</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">hope I provided a window into this fascinating world. The most important reporting strategy in</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">this instance was to talk to as many people as possible, on and off the record, so that I had a real</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">sense of this environment, rather than simply what people tell you when they know it will be</span><br><span style="color:#4C4CE6;">published.</span><br>&nbsp;</p>
